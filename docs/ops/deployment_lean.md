# Lean / minimum-cost deployment

A cost-minimized variant of [`deployment.md`](deployment.md). Same providers, same
mechanics, same IaC — it just **defers the expensive, additive services** and leans on
each one's graceful-degradation path so a fully usable web app ships for ~$10/mo
(rock-bottom) instead of ~$70.

This is a launch strategy, not a different architecture. Every deferred service re-attaches
later by setting one env var or standing up one Fly app — nothing here paints you into a
corner. Read [`deployment.md`](deployment.md) first for the full topology; this file only
records **what to leave out at launch and why it's safe**.

Web-first is already the house position ([decisions.md § 24](../architecture/decisions.md#24-web-is-the-canonical-feature-surface-mobile-and-watches-are-platform-additive)) — the web app is the
canonical feature surface, so a web-only launch loses no capability the product depends on.

## Where the money is

Almost all of the full-plan cost is three deferrable line items: the two Fly.io routing
engines and the mobile-store fees.

| Service | Full-plan / mo | Load-bearing? | Lean verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Supabase Pro | $25 | Backups + no auto-pause | Keep on Lean; **Free ($0)** on Rock-bottom (see risk below) |
| Fly OSRM (8 GB) + 20 GB vol | ~$33 | No — map-matching is cosmetic | **Defer** |
| Fly GraphHopper (4 GB) + vol | ~$16.50 | No — route generation is additive | **Defer** |
| Fly graph_cycle (Go sidecar) | ~$5+ (not separately costed in the docs) | No — v3 loop generator, tried first for route generation | **Defer** |
| Fly worker (256 MB) | ~$5 | Email / push / live / photo thumbnails | Keep on Lean; **defer** on Rock-bottom |
| AWS S3 + CloudFront + Lambda + R53 zone + KMS + alarms (prod only) | ~$3 | Yes — the web app | Keep |
| AWS WAF (coach ACL + 2 rate rules) | ~$7 | Denial-of-wallet guard on /api/coach + /api/routes/generate | **Keep both tiers** (fixed cost, on by default) |
| Anthropic (Coach) | ~$15 usage | Optional feature | Hard-cap on Lean; **off** on Rock-bottom |
| Domain (.com) | ~$1 | Yes | Keep |
| MapTiler / Resend / RevenueCat | $0 free tier | — | Keep (free) |
| Apple Developer $99/yr + Play $25 once | ~$8.25 | Only for mobile launch | **Defer** (web-first) |

## Two tiers

### Lean — ~$41–56/mo

Fully functional web launch with backups intact.

- Supabase **Pro** ($25) — daily PITR backups + no auto-pause. Do not cut this once real
  users exist; the backup gap is not worth $25.
- AWS prod web-stack (~$3), `preview` env deferred.
- Fly **worker only** (~$5) — email, web push, live spectator, photo thumbnails, premium
  compute endpoints. No OSRM, no GraphHopper.
- Coach **on**, with a manual Anthropic console spend cap (~$30). Pro is
  sellable (`PUBLIC_COACH_ENABLED=true`), but leave `PUBLIC_ROUTE_GEN_ENABLED`
  unset — the route engines are still deferred here, and the flag keeps the
  Pro card + `/routes/new` from advertising the dead perk (decisions §204).
- No mobile stores.

### Rock-bottom — ~$10–11/mo (coach off) — SELECTED 2026-07-02, DEPLOYED 2026-07-11

Absolute floor. Appropriate **pre-launch / no real users** or for a demo. Accepts real
tradeoffs (below).

- Supabase **Free** ($0) — **auto-pauses after 7 days idle and has no daily backups.**
- AWS prod web-stack (~$3), `preview` env deferred, coach Lambda left at 503.
- AWS **WAF kept** (~$7) — the per-IP denial-of-wallet guard on `/api/coach` + `/api/routes/generate`. Fixed cost, on by default (`waf_enabled = true`); left in place so it's already there when coach flips on, and prod tightens the coach limit to 30 req / 5 min / IP (`waf_rate_limit`, module default 100). This ~$7 is the bulk of the rock-bottom bill.
- AWS Budgets ceiling set to **$30** (`envs/prod`, forecast alarm at 100 %) so the account can't quietly drift ~3x above the ~$10 baseline before anyone notices.
- Domain (~$1/mo).
- **No Fly services at all** (no worker, no OSRM, no GraphHopper, no graph_cycle).
- Coach **off** (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unset → endpoint returns 503).
- **Pro not sold + AI surface hidden** (`PUBLIC_COACH_ENABLED` and
  `PUBLIC_ROUTE_GEN_ENABLED` both unset). Pro's perks are the Coach and
  server-side route generation (decisions §204); with the Coach off and the
  engines deferred, Pro delivers nothing — `/settings/upgrade` shows a
  "Pro — coming soon" teaser and leads with donations rather than selling a
  hollow subscription (also a consumer-protection / chargeback risk). The coach
  flag hides every web entry point into the AI Coach (sidebar nav, the `/coach`
  chat → "coming soon", the dashboard promo, the route-detail AI upsell, the
  `/compare` link) so nothing surfaces a door that only 503s; the static
  guided-runs rail and the offline "Describe this route" template stay. The
  route-gen flag hides the `/routes/new` Pro upsell and the Pro-card bullet —
  and the generate endpoint answers 501 *before* its tier gate, so nothing ever
  answers "upgrade" for the deferred engines. The tier machinery stays dormant;
  set each flag true when its feature goes live to restore it all with no code
  change. See [paywall.md](../features/paywall.md).
- No mobile stores. MapTiler + Resend on free tiers.

> **Two Lambdas deploy either way.** The web-stack module provisions both the `coach` and the
> `generate-route` Lambda. Both still deploy at rock-bottom and cost effectively nothing when
> idle (pay-per-invoke) — coach returns 503 (no Anthropic key), generate-route returns 501 (no
> engines). No action needed; just don't be surprised they exist.

> **Rock-bottom risk — Supabase Free.** The 7-day inactivity pause and absence of backups
> make Free unsuitable the moment you have users whose data you can't afford to lose. The
> upgrade is one click in the Supabase dashboard (Free → Pro, +$25) with no redeploy — treat
> it as the first thing you do when launch stops being a demo.

## What each deferral costs the user experience

| Deferred | What breaks | What still works | Re-enable |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OSRM** | `map_match` jobs land `status='skipped'`; no road-snapped polyline overlay | Runs record, upload, and display normally | Stand up the `osrm` Fly app, set `OSRM_URL` on the worker; stale rows re-match on next claim (no schema change) |
| **GraphHopper + graph_cycle** | "Generate a route by distance" is unconfigured: with both `GRAPHHOPPER_URL` and `GRAPH_CYCLE_URL` unset the generate-route Lambda returns 501 (checked *before* the Pro tier gate, so no upsell for the dead perk — decisions §204) and the web client falls back to its client-side OSRM heuristic | Manual route drawing, search, snap-to-road; the heuristic still produces a rough loop for every tier | Stand up the `graph_cycle` and/or `graphhopper` Fly app(s) + set `GRAPH_CYCLE_URL` / `GRAPHHOPPER_URL` (and the matching sops shared-secret keys) on the generate-route Lambda; set `PUBLIC_ROUTE_GEN_ENABLED=true` on the web build so the Pro perk is advertised (server generation is Pro-gated; free stays on the heuristic) |
| **Worker** (Rock-bottom) | App-notification emails, weekly digest, web push, live spectator hub, **server-side photo thumbnails + EXIF defense-in-depth** all go dark; `strava_event` / `photo_process` / email jobs queue but don't drain | Auth email (password reset / magic link) via Supabase's own SMTP; runs record + sync + display; **client-side EXIF strip still runs before upload** (`exif_strip` twin), so photos don't leak GPS — they just get no server thumbnail | Deploy the `job_worker` Fly app (+$5); queued jobs drain on first boot |
| **Coach** | `/api/coach` returns 503 | Everything else | Set the Anthropic key + console cap; re-apply the env stack |
| **Mobile stores** | No Android / iOS / Wear listings | The web app is the full-feature surface | Apple Developer + Play Console enrolment + the mobile release workflows |
| **`preview` env** | No per-PR preview URLs | Prod deploys | `terraform apply` in `infra/envs/preview` (+1 KMS key, ~$1.50/mo) |

## Rock-bottom deploy steps

The mechanics are a strict subset of [`infra/README.md` § First-time deploy](../../infra/README.md#first-time-deploy)
and [`apps/backend/deployment.md`](../../apps/backend/deployment.md). The only differences from the full path are:
Supabase Free instead of Pro, **stop before the Anthropic secret phase** (coach stays 503),
and **skip every Fly service**.

### 1. Backend — Supabase Free

Create the project in the dashboard on the **Free** tier (region `eu-west-2`, or match your
users). No custom domain on Free — clients use the raw `https://<ref>.supabase.co` URL
everywhere `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `public_supabase_url` is consumed (**do not** use
`api.threkir.com`; that subdomain is a Pro-only custom domain and won't resolve on Free).

```bash
cd apps/backend
supabase link --project-ref <ref>
supabase db push          # applies every migration; a few minutes on a fresh project
```

Deploy the rock-bottom Edge Function subset — the functions the web app actually calls
that work without gated secrets (platform-injected env only; deployed 2026-07-11):

```bash
for fn in clip-public-track delete-account export-data race-results-import race-listings-sync; do
  supabase functions deploy "$fn" --project-ref <ref>
done
```

- `clip-public-track` — privacy-zone clipping for non-owner track viewers (privacy
  invariant, not optional). `delete-account` — GDPR erasure; the third-party sweeps
  (RevenueCat / FCM / Stripe) record `skipped` when their keys are unset. `export-data` —
  nominally deprecated for the Go worker's queued rail, but the worker is exactly what
  this tier defers, so the EF is the load-bearing export path on this tier. Note the
  consequence for MOBILE: since [decisions § 724](../architecture/decisions.md) the
  mobile client speaks only the queued rail, so without the worker its Account export
  tile has no service to call and says so — the on-device Full backup is what mobile
  gets on this tier, and it does not carry the personal-data table set. `race-results-import` +
  `race-listings-sync` — the parkrun and manual-paste legs work keyless; the
  RunSignUp / UltraSignup / ChronoTrack legs answer 503 `provider_not_configured`.
- **Skip**: `strava-import` (needs Strava OAuth creds, and token refresh lives on the
  deferred worker — connections would go stale; Strava re-attaches with the worker rung),
  `refresh-tokens` + `strava-webhook` (deprecated worker rollback paths, nothing calls
  them), `revenuecat-webhook` (Pro isn't sold at this tier), and the Stripe money track
  (`events-connect-onboard` / `events-checkout` / `events-cancel` / `donations-checkout` /
  `stripe-events-webhook` — gated on keys + sign-off, all 503 fail-closed).
- **Optional — `auth-email`** (six-locale branded auth mail,
  [email.md § GoTrue auth emails](../features/email.md#gotrue-auth-emails-auth-email-edge-function)):
  deploy the function and set `SEND_EMAIL_HOOK_SECRET` + `SMTP_*` secrets **before**
  enabling the Dashboard → Auth → Hooks send-email hook — the hook is fail-closed, so
  enabling it against an unconfigured function stops all auth mail. Without it, GoTrue's
  built-in English templates send via the dashboard SMTP below, which is fine at this tier.

> **Wire a custom SMTP even at rock-bottom.** Supabase's built-in auth email sender
> (`noreply@mail.app.supabase.io`) is heavily rate-limited (a few messages/hour) and
> spam-folders for a large fraction of recipients — so signup confirmation / magic-link /
> password-reset email is a real launch blocker on the default sender. Point Supabase Auth →
> SMTP settings at a free Resend account with SPF + DKIM on your domain ($0). Add the
> DKIM/SPF/MX records Resend hands you via `email_auth_records` in
> `infra/dns/terraform.tfvars` (then apply the dns stack) — not by hand in the console, so
> a DR rebuild keeps deliverability. This is
> independent of the deferred Go worker (which handles *app-level* email, not auth email).

### 2. Web — AWS prod only

Follow the infra walkthrough but apply only `bootstrap → dns → github-oidc → envs/prod`, and
**stop after the first prod apply**. The Lambda comes up with a placeholder coach key and
returns 503 for `/api/coach` — that is the intended rock-bottom state, not a failure. Skip
`sops-init` / `secret-set` / the re-apply.

```bash
bin/aws-preflight.sh          # confirm tooling + AWS auth
bin/deploy-prod.sh            # bootstrap + dns + oidc + envs/prod, idempotent
# STOP HERE — do not run sops-init / secret-set. Coach 503 is expected.
```

Register a domain first (any registrar; ~$1/mo amortized for a `.com`) and paste the four NS
records the `dns` stack outputs. If the domain is registered **in Route 53 itself**,
registration auto-created its own hosted zone and pointed the domain at it — switch the
registered domain's name servers to the Terraform zone's set
(`aws route53domains update-domain-nameservers --region us-east-1 …`) and delete the
auto-created duplicate zone ($0.50/mo). The `dns` apply blocks on ACM validation until this
delegation is live.

> **New-account gotcha — Lambda concurrency quota.** Fresh AWS accounts get an account-wide
> Lambda concurrent-executions quota of **10**, and a reservation must leave ≥10 unreserved —
> so the web-stack's reserved-concurrency bill caps (20/25) cannot apply at all
> (`PutFunctionConcurrency` → InvalidParameterValueException). Request the Service Quotas
> raise to 1000 (`aws service-quotas request-service-quota-increase --service-code lambda
> --quota-code L-B99A9384 --desired-value 1000`) **before** the first envs/prod apply — new
> accounts get routed to human review, which can take a business day. Until it lands, set
> `lambda_reserved_concurrency = -1` and `generate_route_reserved_concurrency = -1` in the
> env tfvars (the 10-wide account pool is itself the tighter bill cap meanwhile) and revert
> the two lines + re-apply once approved.

**Required `infra/envs/prod/terraform.tfvars` values — the apply hard-fails validation without them:**

- `public_supabase_url` — the raw `https://<ref>.supabase.co` (**not** the example's
  `api.threkir.com`, which is Pro-only).
- `public_supabase_anon_key` — the publishable (anon) key, not service-role.
- `budget_alert_emails` and `alert_emails` — **both required, both reject empty and
  `@example.com` placeholders** (the committed `terraform.tfvars.example` ships `you@example.com`,
  which fails validation by design). Set a real address on each.
- `monthly_budget_limit_usd` — lower to ~$50 for a lean launch (default 200).

The account-wide budget is applied by this **local** `deploy-prod.sh` run, not by the `web@*`
CI deploy (the OIDC deploy role deliberately lacks `budgets:*`), so run the local apply at least
once.

Set the required build-input GitHub secrets (`PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` = the same raw
`<ref>.supabase.co` URL, `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY`) before the first
`web@*` deploy, then push to trigger `release-web.yml`. `PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_WEB_CHECKOUT_URL`
is NOT needed at this tier: with both Pro perk flags (`PUBLIC_COACH_ENABLED` /
`PUBLIC_ROUTE_GEN_ENABLED`) unset the empty checkout link matches the "Pro — coming soon"
teaser. It is not required with a perk on either: Coach on and no checkout link is the
app-only storefront, where Pro is sold in the iPhone app and the release guard
(`check_production_env.mjs`) prints a `::notice::` instead of failing (decisions § 1826). A
value that IS set must be `https://pay.rev.cat/<token>` or the guard fails the release.

### 3. Skip Fly entirely

Do not deploy `job_worker`, `osrm`, or `graphhopper`. Leave `OSRM_URL` and the generate-route
Lambda's `GRAPHHOPPER_URL` unset — both paths fail closed and degrade as in the table above.
`flyctl` isn't even needed on the operator machine at this tier.

---

## Manual guardrails (the IaC can't set these)

Even at the floor, wire the provider-side ceilings that code cannot enforce:

- **Supabase egress/usage alert** — project settings. (Free has hard caps but set the alert.)
- **AWS budget** — Terraformed (`infra/envs/prod/budgets.tf`), fires at 50/100 % ACTUAL +
  100 % FORECASTED. Set `monthly_budget_limit_usd` low (~$50).
- **Anthropic console spend limit** — only relevant once the coach is turned on; set at
  <https://console.anthropic.com/settings/limits>.

Full ceiling inventory: [`deployment.md` § Cost-control ceilings](deployment.md#cost-ladder).

---

## Turn-it-back-on ladder (as you grow)

1. **Supabase Free → Pro** (+$25) — the first upgrade; buys backups + kills the auto-pause. One
   dashboard click, no redeploy.
2. **Worker** (+$5) — restores email, web push, live spectator, photo thumbnails. Deploy the
   `job_worker` Fly app; queued jobs drain on first boot.
3. **Coach** (+~$15 capped) — set the Anthropic key + console cap, re-apply the env stack.
4. **OSRM** (+~$33) — when the map-match skip rate becomes a visible annoyance.
5. **GraphHopper (+~$16.50) and/or graph_cycle (+~$5)** — when users ask for route-by-distance
   generation; set `GRAPHHOPPER_URL` / `GRAPH_CYCLE_URL` + the matching sops shared secrets.
6. **`preview` env** (+~$1.50) — when you want per-PR preview URLs.
7. **Apple / Play + mobile builds** (+$8.25/mo) — when web traction justifies the store overhead.
