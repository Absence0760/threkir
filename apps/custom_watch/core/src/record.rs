//! Recording state machine — a host-testable port of the Dart `run_recorder`.
//!
//! [`Recorder`] reduces control commands (start / pause / resume / stop), a
//! stream of [`Fix`] samples, and a wall clock into the live run totals a watch
//! face reads: total distance, elapsed vs moving time, current speed, average /
//! current pace, and the lap counters (a 1 km auto-lap plus the manual
//! [`lap`](Recorder::lap) the Lap button drives — laps live in RAM for the
//! face's lap page only). The point-acceptance filter (min-distance,
//! implausible-jump, max-speed) and the moving-time speed gate reproduce the
//! constants the mobile recorder ships — see each `pub const` below.
//!
//! Pure logic, exactly like [`crate::fix`] and [`crate::face`]: no peripherals,
//! no Embassy, no allocator. Distances use the equirectangular projection the
//! Dart recorder already uses for its route-segment math (`_distanceToSegmentMetres`)
//! rather than a great-circle call, because this `no_std` crate takes no math
//! dependency and the two agree to well under a millimetre at the metres-apart
//! spacing of successive fixes.
