/**
 * Playwright e2e config for apps/web.
 *
 * Prereq: local Supabase up via `cd apps/backend && supabase start`.
 * The dev server is auto-started by the webServer block below.
 *
 * Why `vite dev` instead of `vite build && vite preview`:
 *   the app's eleven `+server.ts` endpoints are not in an
 *   adapter-static build. `/api/coach` and the `/api/routes/osrm`
 *   proxy declare `prerender = false`, so nothing is emitted for them
 *   and `vite preview` would answer a POST to `/api/coach` with the
 *   SPA fallback — a 200 of HTML. `cross-cutting/paywall-wire.spec.ts`
 *   posts there directly to pin the SERVER-side tier gate (429 at the
 *   cap, 401 anonymous) and `cross-cutting/tier-cache-resilience.spec.ts`
 *   fetches it to prove the handler re-reads the tier per call; both
 *   would stop testing anything without failing. Production serves
 *   those endpoints as Lambdas (decisions §53), which `vite preview`
 *   has no equivalent of either. Second reason: a static build bakes
 *   `PUBLIC_*` at BUILD time, so the `webServer.env` overrides below —
 *   which force the localhost tile + OSRM services empty — would have
 *   to move into the build command to have any effect at all.
 *
 *   Not the reason, though it stood here until round 41: an asset-base
 *   break on deep links. SvelteKit computes the relative
 *   `new URL("..", location)` base only when the page is NOT the
 *   fallback (`!state.prerendering?.fallback` in kit's
 *   `runtime/server/page/render.js`); the fallback carries the literal
 *   `paths.base` and absolute `_app/` URLs, so `/runs/<id>` cannot
 *   break them. The claim also named `fallback: "index.html"`, which
 *   the build has not produced since the shell was renamed to
 *   `200.html` (svelte.config.js, decisions § 1268).
 *
 * Local dev: `cd apps/web && pnpm test:e2e` (auto-boots dev server).
 * Or `pnpm test:e2e:ui` for the UI picker.
 *
 * PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL moves the whole lane to another port — the dev
 * server this config boots, the readiness probe, and `use.baseURL` all
 * come off the one resolved value, so a second checkout can run the
 * suite beside a first without the two fighting over :7777.
 *
 * The fixtures/auth.ts globalSetup signs each seeded user in once via
 * the UI and saves their storage state to .auth/<user>.json. Spec
 * files attach the storage state via test.use({ storageState: ... }).
 * .auth/ is gitignored.
