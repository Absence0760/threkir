# Challenges & competitions — implementation plan

> **Status:** **Shipped (web + mobile) 2026-06-19** — migrations `20270209_001_challenges.sql` + `20270210_001_challenge_progress_rpc.sql`; **`vert` (elevation) metric added 2026-06-20 — migration `20270302_001_challenge_vert_metric.sql`, ADR §186** (resolves Open Question 1). Three scopes (individual / club_vs_club / group_goal), five metrics (distance / duration / **vert** / activity_count / streak_days), runs-only, self-hiding strip on web `/dashboard` + the `/social?tab=challenges` tab + the mobile Social Challenges sub-tab, completion badge + `challenge_complete` notification via the opportunistic RPC + a daily `sweep-challenge-completions` pg_cron job. The `challenge_progress` TS↔Dart parity pair backs the progress bar + ranking. No paywall, no compliance gate. Tracked in [roadmap.md § Planned features](../product/roadmap.md#planned-features--specced-2026-06-15).
>
> **Design deltas from the original spec, decided at landing:**
> - **`challenge_leaderboard` is SECURITY DEFINER, not invoker** (gated on `is_challenge_visible`). The "public runs readable by anyone" RLS policy on `runs` was retired (public access now flows through the `public_runs` view / `clip-public-track`), so a SECURITY INVOKER aggregate would see only the caller's own runs and zero every competitor. DEFINER + a visibility gate lets the board sum each opted-in participant's runs (incl. private ones — only the per-user SUM is exposed, never the rows, exactly like `event_results`). The completion RPC + sweep are likewise DEFINER and read base `runs` directly.
> - **`vert` was added in a follow-on slice** (`20270302_001`, ADR §186): it first-classes total ascent as a real `runs.elevation_gain_m` column (backfilled from `metadata.elevation_m`), summed as `sum(coalesce(elevation_gain_m, 0))` and projected into `activities.summary` + `public_runs`. The metric set is now distance / duration / vert / activity_count / streak_days.

## On-pace projection (2026-07-01)

A joined, time-boxed **goal** challenge shows an on-pace hint alongside the
progress bar so a runner knows whether they're on track, not just how far
they've come. `challengePace(value, goal, startMs, endMs, nowMs)` (in the
`challenge_progress` TS↔Dart pair) is a pure re-shape of the value the
leaderboard already computed — **no new data, no extra query**: it derives the
even-pace line (`goal × elapsedFraction`), an `ahead` / `on_track` / `behind`
verdict within a shared `ON_PACE_BAND` (±5 %), a linear final-value projection,
the metric still remaining, and the daily rate needed to finish. It returns
`upcoming` / `active` / `ended` status and nulls every goal-derived field on a
goal-less (pure-ranking) board.

`ChallengeProgressBar.svelte` (web) takes optional `startsAt`/`endsAt` and
renders the verdict — plus a `{rate} per day to finish` line when behind — only
for an active, not-yet-complete goal challenge; it self-hides otherwise. Wired
on the challenge detail page and the self-hiding `ChallengesPanel` dashboard/
social strip. The mobile `challenge_detail_screen.dart` mirrors the hint under
its progress bar. The verdict is unit/locale-agnostic in the helper; the UI
formats the rate through the existing metric formatters. 22 mirror unit tests
each side (`challenge_progress.test.ts` / `challenge_progress_test.dart`), a web
Playwright `pace.spec.ts`, and a `challenge_detail_screen_test.dart` widget test
pin it.

## Goal & user value

Let runners join time-boxed **challenges** — "run 100 km in June", "20,000 m of vert this quarter", "run 20 days this month", "longest streak", "30 activities" — and watch a live leaderboard + personal progress bar fill as their logged activities accrue. Three social shapes: **individual** (everyone competes solo on one board), **club-vs-club** (each club's members pool a combined total, clubs ranked against each other), and **group-goal** (a club or ad-hoc cohort works toward one shared target — a co-op bar, not a ranking). It is the flagship engagement loop: it reuses the existing activity log, clubs, and follow graph rather than introducing a parallel data world, and it **self-hides entirely** when the user is in no challenge so non-joiners never see clutter. Completion fires a notification + records a durable badge.

## What already exists to build on (verified)

Backend / schema:
- `apps/backend/supabase/migrations/20260416_001_clubs_and_events.sql` — `clubs`, `club_members`, the `is_club_admin(uuid)` SECURITY DEFINER helper, the `club_members` SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE RLS pattern to copy. Member roles + status: `club_members.role` / `status` (`active`/`pending`). Helpers `is_event_organiser` / `is_race_director` live in the `private` schema (moved by `20261120_001`).
- `apps/backend/supabase/migrations/20261209_001_activities_view_is_public.sql` — the **`activities` UNION view** (`id, user_id, kind ∈ {run,lift,meal}, started_at, summary jsonb, is_public`), `security_invoker = true`. `summary` carries `distance_m` / `duration_s` / `activity_type` (runs), `volume_kg` / `set_count` (lifts). This is the single read-time spine challenge progress is computed from.
- `runs` table: `started_at`, `distance_m`, `duration_s`, and `runs.metadata` jsonb. `activity_type` is a **real column** (promoted from `metadata` by `20261207_001_promote_activity_type_is_dnf.sql`) and the `activities` view projects it into `summary->>'activity_type'`. Vert is NOT a first-class column — `runs` has no elevation column (only `id, user_id, started_at, duration_s, distance_m, track, route_id, source, external_id, metadata, created_at, updated_at` per `20260405_001_initial_schema.sql`), so total elevation gain lives only in `runs.metadata` and is not currently projected into `activities.summary` — see Open Questions. `apps/backend/supabase/migrations/20260601_001_runs_metadata_activity_type_required.sql` was the earlier guardrail that required `metadata.activity_type` before the column promotion.
- RPC patterns to copy: `event_next_instance_going_counts` (`20270122_001_event_next_instance_going_counts.sql`) — the canonical "push the per-row aggregate into SQL, return a `table(...)`, `security invoker`, `grant execute ... to authenticated, anon`" shape that kills the N+1. `mark_attendance` (`20270102_001_event_attendance.sql`) — the SECURITY DEFINER write-path-RPC + column-grant lockdown idiom.
- `notifications` table (`20260528000001_notifications.sql`): `user_id`, `actor_id`, `kind` (CHECK widened most recently in `20270107_001_notify_plan_assigned.sql` to 12 values — **a new kind means re-stating the full CHECK at the chain end**), nullable source FKs, `read_at`. SECURITY DEFINER triggers insert (regular users can't). The notification email/push channels are opt-in allowlists, so a new in-app kind stays bell-only by default.
- Narrow-union pattern: `apps/web/src/lib/types.ts` carries `ClubRole`, `RsvpStatus`, `EventCategory`, etc. as TS unions overlaid via `Omit<Row, ...> & {...}`, each paired with a DB CHECK. The CHECK↔union guard is `apps/web/scripts/check_constraint_unions.mjs` (`PAIRS` array — append new pairs here).

Web:
- `apps/web/src/lib/core/data.ts` — all Supabase queries. Existing social helpers to mirror in style: `browseClubs` / `fetchMyClubs` / `fetchClubBySlug` / `enrichClubs` (client-side enrichment join, `1665`), `createClub` (`1704`), `joinClub` (`1833`). `fetchEventResults` / `submitEventResult`. Engagement counts via the `run_engagement_counts` RPC (`4660`) — the no-N+1 precedent.
- `apps/web/src/lib/runs/race_leaderboard.ts#compareLeaderboard` — deterministic leaderboard tie-break (value desc → tiebreak → id). Reuse the **shape**; challenge ranking is a sibling pure helper.
- `apps/web/src/lib/runs/streaks.ts#computeRunStreaks` (parity pair with `apps/mobile_android/lib/streaks.dart`) — pure streak math, reuse directly for the streak challenge metric.
- `/social` hub: `apps/web/src/routes/social/+page.svelte` — ARIA tab strip (Feed / People / Clubs / Discover) with `?tab=` URL state, panels `SocialFeed` / `SocialPeople` / `SocialClubs` / `SocialDiscover` in `apps/web/src/lib/components/`.
- Create-flow modal pattern + `.modal` / `.editor-form` / `.btn-*` / `.card-elevated` global classes (`app.css`).

Mobile:
- `apps/mobile_android/lib/screens/social_screen.dart` — the Social tab host with sub-tabs (Feed / People / Clubs / Discover), each child `embedded: true`. `apps/mobile_android/lib/screens/clubs_screen.dart`, `club_detail_screen.dart`.
- `apps/mobile_android/lib/social_service.dart` — `SocialService` ChangeNotifier singleton, the mobile mirror of web `data.ts` social calls (`fetchMyClubs`, `createClub`, realtime `subscribeToEvent`).
- `apps/mobile_android/lib/local_activities.dart#buildLocalActivities` — offline cross-modal timeline from `LocalRunStore` + `LocalGymStore` + `LocalFoodStore`. Useful for an **offline-optimistic** local progress estimate.
- `packages/api_client` typed methods; `packages/core_models` generated row DTOs (`lib/src/generated/db_rows.dart`).
- i18n: web `src/lib/i18n/locales/{en,de,fr,es,ja,pt-BR}.ts` (parity enforced by `messages_parity.test.ts`); mobile `apps/mobile_android/lib/l10n/app_<locale>.arb` (parity by `test/l10n_parity_test.dart`), regen via `flutter gen-l10n`, mirror to iOS twin.

Verified that **no challenges/competitions feature exists today** (grep of roadmap, parity, clubs.md, code returned nothing). This is greenfield on top of the social layer.

## Data model / migrations

Two consecutive-date migrations (same-day `_NNN` does NOT disambiguate — walk dates per `apps/backend/CLAUDE.md`). Latest existing at spec time is `20270202_001`; the `20270203_001` / `20270204_001` filenames below are **placeholders — re-check the tail of `apps/backend/supabase/migrations/` at landing and assign the next two sequential dates** (other sessions may have landed migrations since this was written).

### `20270203_001_challenges.sql` — core schema + RLS

);

RLS shape (copy `club_members` / `events` policies):
- `challenges` SELECT: `is_public = true` OR caller is creator OR (club_id is not null AND caller is an active member of that club via the `club_members` exists-subquery) OR caller is a participant. Fail-closed.
- `challenges` INSERT: `auth.uid() = creator_id` AND, when `club_id is not null`, `is_club_admin(club_id)` (only club admins create club-anchored challenges; open challenges anyone may create — revisit in Open Questions). UPDATE/DELETE: creator or `is_club_admin(club_id)`.
- `challenge_participants` SELECT: anyone who can SELECT the parent challenge (exists-subquery on `challenges` visibility — single source of truth, mirrors the event_attendees-inherits-events idiom). INSERT: `auth.uid() = user_id` AND the parent challenge is visible AND (for club-anchored / club_vs_club) the user is an active member of `team_club_id`. DELETE (leave): `auth.uid() = user_id`. `completed_at` is **column-locked** and written only by the SECURITY DEFINER progress RPC (copy the `event_attendees` attendance column-grant lockdown from `20270102_001`). INSERT is column-scoped too, to `(challenge_id, user_id, team_club_id)` — `20270616_001`. It was table-wide, and since join and leave are both own-row verbs a participant could delete their row and re-insert it with `completed_at` already set, forging the completion in two statements ([decisions § 763](../architecture/decisions.md), the [§ 584](../architecture/decisions.md) class).
- `challenge_badges` SELECT: `auth.uid() = user_id` OR the badge's challenge is public (so a profile can show earned badges). INSERT: closed to clients — only the SECURITY DEFINER completion path. No client UPDATE/DELETE.

### `20270204_001_challenge_progress_rpc.sql` — the no-N+1 progress + completion engine

Two RPCs, both `security invoker` for reads (RLS on `activities`/base tables governs) and one SECURITY DEFINER writer for completion:

1. `challenge_leaderboard(p_challenge_id uuid) returns table(user_id uuid, display_name text, team_club_id uuid, value numeric, rank bigint)` — `security invoker`, `stable`. ONE query: join `challenge_participants` to a per-user aggregate over the `activities` view filtered to `started_at` within `[starts_at, ends_at)`, `kind = 'run'` (and `summary->>'activity_type'` when `activity_type` set), summing the metric expression:
   - distance: `sum((summary->>'distance_m')::numeric)`
   - duration: `sum((summary->>'duration_s')::numeric)`
   - activity_count: `count(*)`
   - vert: `sum(coalesce(elevation_gain_m, 0))` over base `runs` (shipped in `20270302_001`, ADR §186 — `runs.elevation_gain_m` is a first-class column, also projected into `activities.summary->>'elevation_gain_m'` for the client estimate)
   - streak_days: computed server-side from per-user distinct activity days in window (a `count(distinct date_trunc('day', started_at))`-style measure within the window; full Strava-grace streak math can also be done client-side by reusing `streaks.ts`/`streaks.dart` over the participant's in-window day set — pick the simpler distinct-day measure for the board, document the choice).
   For `club_vs_club`, a second grouping path aggregates by `team_club_id` (returned via a sibling RPC `challenge_team_leaderboard` or a `p_by_team boolean` arg). The key property: **N participants → 1 round trip, 0 client-side per-user fetches.** `rank` via `rank() over (order by value desc)`.

2. `my_active_challenges() returns table(... challenge fields ..., my_value numeric, my_rank bigint, participant_count bigint)` — `security invoker`, the **self-hiding driver**: returns only challenges the caller has joined that are currently live (`now() between starts_at and ends_at`) OR recently ended/completed (small window). An empty result set is the signal to render nothing.

3. `recompute_challenge_completion(p_challenge_id uuid, p_user_id uuid) returns void` — SECURITY DEFINER. Recomputes the caller's value via the same aggregate, and when `goal_value` is met and no badge row exists, inserts `challenge_badges` + stamps `challenge_participants.completed_at` + inserts a `challenge_complete` notification. Idempotent (the `unique(user_id, challenge_id)` badge row guards double-award). Called opportunistically by the client after a run saves (cheap, fail-closed) and/or by a daily pg_cron sweep (`enqueue`-style) for robustness. **Do not** put completion in a per-run trigger that fans out across all challenges — keep it on the explicit RPC + cron sweep to bound write amplification.

4. `browse_public_challenges(p_search text, p_limit int, p_offset int) returns table(<challenge fields>, participant_count integer)` — **SECURITY DEFINER**, `stable` (migration `20270308_001`, ADR §190). The ranked, paginated, searchable **Browse discovery feed**: public challenges the caller hasn't joined, still open (`ends_at > now()`), ordered by **popularity** `participant_count + joins_7d*2` (size + a 7-day join-velocity boost so momentum outranks a stale big board), tie-break `ends_at asc, created_at desc, id`. Throwaway suppression hides participant-less boards past a 7-day grace window unless the caller created them. DEFINER (unlike the two reader RPCs above) because the velocity term counts ALL recent joins — a non-participant's RLS on `challenge_participants` would undercount it — and the function only ever returns public challenges + aggregate counts, no per-user rows. `participant_count` is read from the trigger-maintained cache column (below), so Browse never aggregates participants at read time. Client: `browsePublicChallenges()` in `data.ts`; web `/challenges` Browse uses it with a debounced search box + Load-more pagination.

**`challenges.participant_count` cache (migration `20270308_001`):** a denormalised `integer` column on `challenges`, recompute-from-`count(*)` on every join/leave via the `challenge_participants_count_sync` trigger (SECURITY DEFINER — a joiner has no UPDATE grant on the challenge row). Registered in [`derived_state.md`](../backend/derived_state.md). Authoritative query: `count(*) from challenge_participants where challenge_id = …`.

**Spam backstop (resolves Open Question 2):** a `before insert on challenges` trigger (`enforce_challenge_create_rate_limit`) throttles authenticated creation to 30/hour on the `create_challenge` bucket. Since migration `20270610_001` the body is one `perform enforce_create_rate_limit('create_challenge', new.creator_id, 30, 3600)` ([decisions § 747](../architecture/decisions.md)), so it inherits the shared helper's skips (`service_role`, `auth.uid() is null` for seed/service inserts, and a `creator_id` the caller does not own — that one is left to the RLS `WITH CHECK` to refuse with 42501) and, more to the point, the helper's refusal message: `rate limit exceeded for create_challenge, retry in Ns`, which is the literal both client parsers read. The original body raised the bare string `challenge_create_rate_limited` and wrapped the RPC call in a fail-open `exception when others`; both are gone.

**Resolved (migration `20270302_001`, ADR §186):** elevation gain is now the first-class `runs.elevation_gain_m` column (backfilled from `metadata.elevation_m`), summed directly off base `runs` like the other metrics. The `activities` view's runs branch projects `'elevation_gain_m', r.elevation_gain_m` into its `summary jsonb_build_object` so the client-side `metricFromActivity` estimate reads the SAME number the server sum does. (The view re-state in that migration also carries forward the lift branch's materialized `set_count`/`volume_kg` columns from `20261214_001` — the bare-body trap applies to views too.)

CHECK↔union pairs to register in `apps/web/scripts/check_constraint_unions.mjs` `PAIRS`: `ChallengeMetric` ↔ `challenges_metric_ck`, `ChallengeScope` ↔ `challenges_scope_ck`. (`activity_type` reuses the existing `ActivityType` pair.)

Codegen after `supabase db reset` (both committed, same commit as the migration):
```
cd apps/backend && npm run gen:types        # apps/web/src/lib/database.types.ts
cd ../.. && dart run scripts/gen_dart_models.dart   # packages/core_models/lib/src/generated/db_rows.dart
```

Seed: add one live open `distance` challenge + one club-anchored `group_goal` for Richmond Run Club to `apps/backend/supabase/seed.sql` (now()-relative window) so `/challenges` is populated on reset.

## Web implementation (canonical)

Routes (new, under the run-vs-social split — challenges are a social/engagement surface, mount in the `/social` hub + a dedicated detail route):
- `apps/web/src/routes/challenges/+page.svelte` — list/browse: My challenges (joined, via `fetchChallenges({mine:true})`) and a **ranked Browse** section (public, popularity-ordered, debounced search + Load-more pagination) backed by the `browse_public_challenges` RPC via `browsePublicChallenges()`. The two lists load independently. Thin; reuses the panel. The joined rows carry a real value: `fetchChallenges({mine:true})` folds `my_active_challenges` in (the `challenges` row itself has no per-caller number), and `myProgressView` in `lib/social/challenge_list.ts` decides what each row may claim — `known` / `not_started` (a true zero, the aggregate's window opens at `starts_at`) / `unknown`, which renders "Progress unavailable" rather than a 0 % bar. ADR §603.
- `apps/web/src/routes/challenges/[id]/+page.svelte` — detail: hero (title, metric, window countdown), the user's **progress bar** (value vs `goal_value`, `prefers-reduced-motion`-safe), live leaderboard (individual rows or club-vs-club team cards or a single co-op group-goal bar), Join/Leave button, creator/admin edit, and a creator/admin **Delete challenge** in a `DangerZone` after the leaderboard, behind its confirm (decisions § 1634). Mobile `challenge_detail_screen.dart` offers the creator the same delete as a labelled `AppBarActions` overflow item.
- `apps/web/src/routes/challenges/new/` — thin page wrapper around the `ChallengeEditor` modal component (create-flow modal pattern; deep-link parity).

Components (`apps/web/src/lib/components/`):
- `ChallengeEditor.svelte` — create/edit form (title, description, metric select, scope select, optional goal, optional activity-type filter, club anchor select from `fetchMyClubs` admin subset, start/end pickers). `class="editor-form"`, `oncreated`/`oncancel` callbacks. Hosted by the modal on `/challenges` AND the `/challenges/new` wrapper. The goal is typed in the reader's own unit and converted through the `challenge_goal` pair; it reads the stored figure back through the leaderboard's formatter, states the window's active-day ceiling for `streak_days`, clears the number when the metric changes, and names both `challenges_goal_ck` refusals plus the end-after-start rule inline (ADR §758).
- `ChallengeLeaderboard.svelte` — renders the `challenge_leaderboard` rows; switches layout by scope. Team rows resolve their club name through `teamLabel` (`lib/social/challenge_list.ts`) and never fall back to the raw `team_club_id` — the detail page feeds it `fetchClubNames(board team ids)` merged over `fetchMyClubs()`, because a club-vs-club board is mostly clubs the viewer is not in. ADR §603. Above the list it renders the viewer's **standing** (`standingFor`, `lib/social/leaderboard_standing.ts`): their rank out of the board size, how many share their rank, and the metric gap to the entrants immediately above and below. On a board of any size the viewer's own row can sit off screen, and "#7 of 24" alone doesn't say whether sixth place is 200 m or 40 km away. The detail page supplies `meTeamId` — on a club-vs-club board the entrant is a club, and it is the club the viewer JOINED under, carried on `ChallengeWithMeta.my_team_club_id` off their own `challenge_participants` row. Nothing stops a runner belonging to two clubs that both field a team on one board, so picking whichever of their clubs appears there credits them to the wrong side (and can tell the trailing team it is winning).
- `ChallengeProgressBar.svelte` — the pure progress bar (value/goal → pct + label).
- `ChallengesPanel.svelte` — **the self-hiding entry point**: calls `myActiveChallenges()`; renders `null`/nothing when the result is empty. Mounted as a strip on `/dashboard` (above or below the stat grid) AND as a new `?tab=challenges` panel in `/social`.

`/social` integration: add a `challenges` tab to `apps/web/src/routes/social/+page.svelte`'s ARIA tab strip (`?tab=challenges`) hosting the browse list. (Keeps the 4→5 social sub-tab; this is a sub-tab, not a top-level nav item — no sidebar ceiling concern on web.)

`data.ts` helpers (`apps/web/src/lib/core/data.ts`):
- `fetchChallenges(opts)`, `fetchChallengeById(id)`, `createChallenge(input)`, `updateChallenge(id, patch)`, `deleteChallenge(id)`, `joinChallenge(id, teamClubId?)`, `leaveChallenge(id)`.
- `fetchChallengeLeaderboard(id, byTeam?)` → wraps `challenge_leaderboard` RPC.
- `fetchClubNames(ids)` → one `.in()` read resolving club ids to display names, RLS-scoped to public clubs plus the caller's own. Backs the club-vs-club team column.
- `myActiveChallenges()` → wraps `my_active_challenges` RPC (the self-hide driver).
- `recomputeChallengeCompletion(id)` → wraps the SECURITY DEFINER RPC. It is fired from the run-save success path via `recomputeChallengesForRun(runStartedAtIso)`, which fans it out over the runner's joined challenges whose window covers the run's `started_at` (the `challengesToRecomputeForRun` parity helper picks the set). Wired into `createManualRun` + `saveRun` (best-effort, swallow-to-debug like the plan-workout auto-match) so a finished run that crosses the line awards the badge promptly instead of waiting up to ~24h for the cron sweep. On mobile (offline-first), the fan-out fires after `saveRunsBatch` lands, from `SyncService` → `SocialService.recomputeChallengesForRuns` over the just-synced runs' `started_at`.
- Route all `.from('challenges' | 'challenge_participants' | 'challenge_badges')` through `core/schema.ts` TABLES registry (add the three names) so the `core/schema.test.ts` bare-string guard stays green.

Pure logic (`apps/web/src/lib/social/`):
- `challenge_progress.ts` — see parity section.
- `leaderboard_standing.ts` — `standingFor(rows, viewerKey)` → the viewer's rank, the board size, how many share their rank, and the nearest entry strictly above / strictly below with the metric units separating them. Rank is derived as one plus the number of strictly better values, which *is* `rank() over (order by value desc)`, so it cannot disagree with the rank the SQL sent and the list renders. Neighbours tie-break on `entryKey` ascending, mirroring the board's `order by rank, <key> nulls last`, so two refreshes name the same entrant. Returns entries, not labels — unit formatting and name/team resolution stay at the UI edge. A pure re-shape of rows the caller already holds: no new query, no new data, and nothing on screen the board below doesn't already show. Twinned by `leaderboard_standing.dart` and registered in both parity registries, as `challenge_list.ts` now is (`challenge_list.dart`, ADR §694) — `check_parity_pair_registry.mjs` polices both.

types.ts overlays (`apps/web/src/lib/types.ts`):
```ts
export type ChallengeMetric = 'distance' | 'duration' | 'vert' | 'activity_count' | 'streak_days';
export type ChallengeScope = 'individual' | 'club_vs_club' | 'group_goal';
export type Challenge = Omit<ChallengeRow, 'metric' | 'scope' | 'activity_type'> & {
  metric: ChallengeMetric; scope: ChallengeScope; activity_type: ActivityType | null;
};
export type ChallengeParticipant = ChallengeParticipantRow;
export type ChallengeBadge = ChallengeBadgeRow;
export type ChallengeLeaderboardRow = { user_id: string; display_name: string | null; team_club_id: string | null; value: number; rank: number };
export type ChallengeWithMeta = Challenge & { participant_count: number; my_value: number | null; my_rank: number | null; joined: boolean };
```

## Mobile implementation (Android + iOS twin)

Mirror after web lands. The mobile nav is at its 5-slot ceiling (`Home / Fitness / Log / Social / You`) — **do not add a 6th tab.** Mount challenges as a **sub-tab inside the Social hub** (`social_screen.dart`), matching how web puts it in `/social`, plus a self-hiding card on the Home dashboard.

Files (under `apps/mobile_android/lib/`, then mirror byte-identical to `apps/mobile_ios/lib/` in the **same commit**):
- `screens/challenges_screen.dart` — Social hub's new Challenges sub-tab (`embedded: true` mode, body-only). Browse + My challenges. The joined rows carry the caller's own value, bar, rank and earned badge, folded in from `my_active_challenges` by `mergeMyProgress` and gated by `myProgressView`: a challenge outside that RPC's live-plus-7-day window renders "Progress unavailable" rather than a 0 % bar (ADR §694).
- `screens/challenge_detail_screen.dart` — hero + progress bar + leaderboard + Join/Leave; admin/creator edit + delete behind `AlertDialog` (destructive-confirm idiom). The caller's value comes off the board the page already holds — `fetchChallengeById` carries none — and the club-vs-club team column resolves through `teamLabel`, never printing a raw club uuid.
- `widgets/challenge_progress_bar.dart` — the shared bar (value/goal label, complete chip, `ProgressBar`, on-pace hint) plus `challengeValueLabel`, rendered by both screens exactly as web shares `ChallengeProgressBar.svelte`.
- `widgets/challenge_form_sheet.dart` — create/edit bottom sheet (mirror `club_form_sheet.dart` / `event_form_sheet.dart`).
- `widgets/challenge_progress_card.dart` — the self-hiding Home dashboard card; renders nothing when `myActiveChallenges` is empty (data-presence self-hide, matching the gym/nutrition cards).
- `social_service.dart` — add `fetchChallenges`, `fetchChallengeById`, `createChallenge`, `joinChallenge`, `leaveChallenge`, `fetchChallengeLeaderboard`, `myActiveChallenges`, `recomputeChallengeCompletion` (route through `packages/api_client`, not direct `.from`).
- `social_screen.dart` — register the Challenges sub-tab + its FAB (Create challenge, admin/eligible only) in the hoisted-FAB slot.
- `dashboard_screen.dart` — mount `challenge_progress_card.dart` (best-effort hydrate on mount like the gym/nutrition cards).

Add the leaderboard/challenge DTOs to `packages/core_models` only if the RPC return shape isn't 1:1 with a generated row (the leaderboard rows aren't a table, so a hand model `ChallengeLeaderboardEntry` in core_models is expected).

Verify twin parity: `diff -rq apps/mobile_android/lib apps/mobile_ios/lib` empty; same for `test/`.

## TS↔Dart parity helpers

One new pair (register it in the conventions parity list + watch with `shared-library-syncer`):
- **`challenge_progress`** — web `apps/web/src/lib/social/challenge_progress.ts` ↔ mobile `apps/mobile_android/lib/challenge_progress.dart`. Pure functions: `progressFraction(value, goal)` (clamp 0..1, null-goal → null), `formatProgressLabel`-feeding parts (locale/unit-agnostic structured parts, NOT formatted strings — the caller localises), `rankParticipants(entries)` (deterministic sort mirroring `compareLeaderboard`: value desc → user_id asc, assigning dense ranks), and `metricFromActivity(summary, metric, activityTypeFilter)` (the SAME metric-extraction math the SQL aggregate uses — so an offline-optimistic client estimate from local stores can't drift from the server board). Matching test counts both sides (target ~12 each, keep identical).
- **`challenge_list`** (added 2026-08-19, ADR §694) — web `apps/web/src/lib/social/challenge_list.ts` ↔ mobile `apps/mobile_android/lib/challenge_list.dart`. `mergeMyProgress` folds the `my_active_challenges` aggregate onto a joined-challenge list, `myProgressView` decides what a row may claim (`known` / `notStarted` — the one true zero, the window has not opened — / `unknown`, which must NOT render a bar), and `teamLabel` resolves a club-vs-club row's club without ever falling back to the raw uuid. 18 web / 17 Dart tests: the web unparseable-`starts_at` guard has no analogue against a typed `DateTime`.
- **`challenge_goal`** (added 2026-08-27, ADR §758) — web `apps/web/src/lib/social/challenge_goal.ts` ↔ mobile `apps/mobile_android/lib/challenge_goal.dart`. `challengeGoalUnit` names the unit the field asks for, `challengeGoalToStored` converts into the column, `maxStreakDaysInWindow` computes the window's active-day ceiling, and `checkChallengeGoal` is the client half of `challenges_goal_ck` — a third rail, since the SQL computes the same ceiling. 16 web / 14 Dart tests: `challengeGoalFromStored` is web-only glue for the edit path, and web's non-finite window guards have no Dart analogue against a typed `int`.
- Reuse the existing `streaks` pair for the `streak_days` metric — do not re-implement streak math.

## Tests

Playwright (`apps/web/tests-e2e/challenges/` — new dir; follow `tests-e2e/clubs/` fixture style, `fixtures/seeded-data.ts` + `fixtures/auth.ts`):
- `create.spec.ts` — create an individual distance challenge via the editor; appears in My challenges.
- `join-leave.spec.ts` — join → participant count increments → leave → removed.
- `leaderboard.spec.ts` — two seeded users with in-window runs rank correctly; ranks deterministic on reload.
- `standing.spec.ts` — a trailing entrant's standing card names their rank, the board size, and the formatted gap to the runner ahead (and claims no one behind when nobody is); a second case pins that tied for the lead reports the tie rather than a bare "Leading".
- `standing-team.spec.ts` — on a club-vs-club board a runner in TWO competing clubs is credited to the one they joined under, not their newest club. Both standing specs filter the challenge to an `activity_type` no other spec seeds, so a sibling spec's in-window run can't move the asserted gap.
- `progress-completion.spec.ts` — a run that crosses `goal_value` flips the progress bar to complete + a badge/notification appears.
- `club-vs-club.spec.ts` — team aggregation ranks clubs.
- `self-hide.spec.ts` — a user in no challenge sees no challenges strip on `/dashboard` and an empty My-challenges section.
- `visibility-rls.spec.ts` — a private/club-only challenge is invisible to a non-member (negative test, mirrors `private-rls-negative.spec.ts`).

pgtap (`apps/backend/supabase/tests/`):
- `challenges_rls_test.sql` — SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policy matrix (creator vs member vs outsider vs anon); fail-closed on private. Use the double-quoted `set local "request.jwt.claims"` idiom; seed `runs` rows WITH `metadata.activity_type`; valid hex UUIDs.
- `challenge_leaderboard_test.sql` — the aggregate returns correct sums/counts/ranks for a fixture of participants + in-window/out-of-window runs (proves the window filter + the single-query shape).
- `challenge_completion_test.sql` — `recompute_challenge_completion` awards exactly one badge, is idempotent, and respects `goal_value`.
- `challenge_participants_completed_lockdown_test.sql` — direct client UPDATE of `completed_at` is rejected (column-grant lockdown); the RPC succeeds; and the DELETE + re-INSERT round trip that used to reach the column is rejected too, with an honest rejoin leaving `completed_at` unset.

Mobile (Flutter, in the same commit as each Dart piece, mirrored to iOS twin):
- `test/challenge_progress_test.dart` — the parity helper (count matches the TS side).
- `test/challenges_screen_test.dart` — list renders, self-hide when empty (use `tester.runAsync` for store I/O; dialog-scoped finders for duplicate labels per the mobile-test gotchas).
- `test/challenge_list_test.dart` — the `challenge_list` parity helper (17 Dart against 18 web).
- `test/challenge_detail_screen_test.dart` — progress bar + Join/Leave + destructive-confirm dialog; plus the board-derived value (never a fabricated zero) and the two `teamLabel` fallbacks.
- `test/social_service_test.dart` — extend with challenge methods (the file is already in the modified set).

Web unit (`apps/web/src/lib/social/challenge_progress.test.ts`) — `npx tsx --test`, count matches Dart.

CHECK↔union guard: `apps/web/scripts/check_constraint_unions.mjs` extended (covered by the existing `parity-types` job).

## i18n keys to add (every web locale + all mobile ARBs)

Representative web keys (`src/lib/i18n/locales/en.ts` template + de/fr/es/ja/pt-BR, real translations — parity test enforces non-empty + placeholder fidelity):
- `challenges.title`, `challenges.myChallenges`, `challenges.browse`, `challenges.empty`
- `challenges.create`, `challenges.join`, `challenges.leave`, `challenges.joined`
- `challenges.metricDistance`, `challenges.metricDuration`, `challenges.metricVert`, `challenges.metricActivityCount`, `challenges.metricStreak`
- `challenges.scopeIndividual`, `challenges.scopeClubVsClub`, `challenges.scopeGroupGoal`
- `challenges.goalProgress` (`"{value} of {goal}"`), `challenges.progressComplete`, `challenges.endsIn` (`"ends in {n} days"`), `challenges.leaderboardRank` (`"#{rank}"`)
- `challenges.standingTitle` / `challenges.standingTitleTeam`, `challenges.standingRank` (`"#{rank} of {total}"`), `challenges.standingTiedOne` / `challenges.standingTiedMany`, `challenges.standingBehind` / `challenges.standingAhead` (`"{gap} behind|ahead of {name}"`), `challenges.standingLeading`
- `challenges.completeNotification` (`"You completed {title}!"`), `challenges.badgeEarned`
- `challenges.deleteConfirm`, `challenges.leaveConfirm`

Mobile ARB equivalents camelCased (`challengesTitle`, `challengesJoin`, `challengesMetricDistance`, `challengesGoalProgress` with `{value}`/`{goal}` placeholders, …) in `app_en.arb` (with `@` metadata) + the other five; `flutter gen-l10n`; mirror `lib/l10n/gen/` to the iOS twin.

## Docs to update (same turns as the code)

- `docs/product/roadmap.md` — add a "Challenges & competitions" entry under Phase 3 social / the competitor-parity backlog with a `[x]` checkbox per slice as it lands (it's a Strava/Nike parity feature).
- `docs/product/parity.md` — add a Challenges row, flip web/android/ios cells as each platform lands.
- `docs/features/clubs.md` — add a "Challenges" subsection (the social layer doc) describing the tables, the activities-view-driven progress, the self-hide contract, scopes, and the badge hook; OR create `docs/features/challenges.md` and link it from `CLAUDE.md`'s doc index table (preferred given the feature's size — add the index row).
- `docs/backend/api_database.md` — document `challenges` / `challenge_participants` / `challenge_badges` tables + RLS + the three RPCs.
- `docs/architecture/conventions.md` — append the `challenge_progress` parity pair to the TS↔Dart lockstep list; also add it to `CLAUDE.md`'s parity-pair enumeration.
- `docs/architecture/decisions.md` — one entry: "Challenge progress is computed at read time from the `activities` view via a single GROUP-BY RPC (no per-participant fetch, no denormalised progress counter), and completion is an explicit RPC + cron sweep, not a per-run fan-out trigger." Note the badge as a durable side-effect table.
- `docs/backend/metadata.md` — only if a new `runs.metadata` key is touched for vert (likely not; vert should be a column/view expr, not a new metadata key).

## Gating / compliance

**None blocking.** No paywall (challenges are a free engagement feature — do not gate behind Pro; if a "Pro-only private challenges" idea surfaces, that's a later, separate decision). No Stripe / payouts. No Art 9 health data beyond what `activities` already exposes under existing RLS. No CISO/counsel sign-off gate. Standard RLS fail-closed is the only safety requirement: private/club challenges and badges must not leak to non-members — pin that with the negative pgtap + Playwright tests above. The leaderboard reveals participant `display_name`; participants opted in by joining, so showing their name to co-participants is consistent with the existing event-results board (no `runner_handle` anonymisation needed — unlike the anon-accessible live spectator page).

## Open questions / decisions owed by the user

1. **Elevation/vert source.** ✅ **Resolved (2026-06-20, migration `20270302_001`, ADR §186).** Total elevation gain lived only in `runs.metadata.elevation_m`. Option (a) was taken: `vert` shipped in a follow-on slice that first-classed total ascent as `runs.elevation_gain_m` (backfilled from the metadata key, which stays for the existing recap/export/Strava/worker/backup readers), summed off base `runs` like the other metrics and projected into `activities.summary` + `public_runs`. Create is web-only; mobile is read-only (label + unit-aware display).
2. **Who can create open (non-club) challenges?** ✅ **Resolved (2026-06-23, migration `20270308_001`, ADR §190).** Anyone authenticated, as planned — but a `before insert on challenges` trigger now throttles creation to 30/hour per user on the `create_challenge` bucket (the spam backstop this question flagged), skipping seed/service inserts. Migration `20270610_001` moved the body onto the shared `enforce_create_rate_limit` helper so the refusal is one the clients can read ([decisions § 747](../architecture/decisions.md)). Discovery side is handled too: `browse_public_challenges` ranks popular boards over throwaway ones and suppresses dead ones, so spam that does get created sinks out of Browse.
3. **club_vs_club team membership at completion.** If a user leaves their club mid-challenge, does their in-window contribution stay with the old team or move? Plan stamps `team_club_id` at join and keeps contributions on that team (simplest, deterministic). Confirm.
4. **streak_days metric definition** — full Strava-grace streak (reuse `streaks.ts`) vs. simple distinct-active-days-in-window count. Plan recommends distinct-active-days for the leaderboard (cheap, unambiguous ranking) and notes the grace-rule streak is a display nicety. Confirm.
5. **Lifts/meals in challenges?** The `activities` view also carries `lift`/`meal`. v1 scopes challenges to runs (`kind='run'`) only. Confirm runs-only for v1; a future "training-minutes" or "activity-count across modalities" metric is an easy extension.
6. **Completion trigger cadence** — opportunistic client RPC on run-save + a daily pg_cron sweep is the plan. Confirm a cron sweep is acceptable (it needs a `pg_cron` schedule like `enqueue_event_reminders`), or whether client-only recompute is sufficient for v1.

## Sequencing for the implementer

1. Read `apps/backend/CLAUDE.md` (migration gotchas), `docs/architecture/schema_codegen.md`, and `20270102_001_event_attendance.sql` + `20270122_001_event_next_instance_going_counts.sql` (the two idioms you'll copy).
2. Resolve Open Questions 1 + 5 with the user (they change the view edit + the metric set). Default to runs-only, vert deferred, if no answer.
3. Write `20270203_001_challenges.sql`; `cd apps/backend && supabase db reset` to confirm it applies; run both type generators; write `challenges_rls_test.sql`; `supabase test db`. Append the two CHECK↔union pairs to `check_constraint_unions.mjs`; add the TS overlays to `types.ts`. Commit (piece 1).
4. Write `20270204_001_challenge_progress_rpc.sql` (the leaderboard + my_active + completion RPCs, and the activities-view vert append if Q1 says vert ships now); reset + regen; write the three pgtap files. Commit (piece 2).
5. Write `apps/web/src/lib/social/challenge_progress.ts` + tests (`npx tsx --test`). Commit (piece 3).
6. Add `data.ts` helpers + `schema.ts` table names. Commit (piece 4).
7. Build the web UI (editor → detail/leaderboard → self-hiding panel + /social tab + dashboard strip), i18n keys in every web locale, Playwright specs. Verify `npm run check --workspace=apps/web` and the specs pass. Commit per-sub-piece (piece 5).
8. Seed challenges (piece 6).
9. Mirror to mobile: parity helper + tests (piece 7), service methods (piece 8), screens + nav + ARBs + gen-l10n + tests, **mirrored byte-identical to the iOS twin and verified with `diff -rq`** (piece 9).
10. Docs sweep — roadmap/parity/feature doc/api_database/conventions/decisions/index (piece 10).
11. Run `/check` (code-reviewer + test-gap + doc-hygiene) before declaring done.
