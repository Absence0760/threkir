// Source-scan register for issue #666's other remainder: an alpha on a
// NON-boundary theme token.
//
// §510 made the ban on thinning `outline` / `outlineVariant` / `dividerColor`
// absolute — a token whose whole guarantee is a 3:1 floor has no headroom to
// spend — and left this class open with an unmeasured count. `primary`,
// `onSurface`, `primaryContainer`, `surface` and the rest DO have headroom, so
// a blanket ban would be wrong. What was actually missing was the measurement:
// none of these had ever been computed against the surface it paints on.
//
// So this is a REGISTER, not a ban. Every surviving thinning is count-pinned per
// file on §480's model, and each entry states the role and the measured number,
// so a NEW thinning fails until somebody measures it and a migrated file forces
// its entry's removal. The numbers themselves are computed, never written here:
// `packages/ui_kit/test/thinned_token_contrast_test.dart` derives each from the
// real `AppTheme` tokens, and pins every repair in both directions.
//
// The rule the register encodes, by role:
//   * FOREGROUND (text) — 4.5:1 composited on its real background.
//   * ICON / BORDER / meaningful mark — 3:1 composited. A boundary that is the
//     ONLY thing separating a container from its page is a mark, however
//     decorative it looks.
//   * a purely decorative WASH — nothing owed, but recorded, because a fill's
//     alpha changes what its own children composite against.
//   * a fill whose PRESENCE is a state signal is not a wash: 1.4.1 needs a
//     non-colour cue beside it. Every entry below that carries state names its
//     cue, because at these alphas (1.00-1.26:1) the tint cannot be the cue.
//
// When this test fails: compute the composited ratio on the surface the site
// actually paints on — not on the convenient plain background, which is §503's
// recorded trap and changed the answer for six of these — then either fix it or
// add an entry saying what you measured.
