#     S3-native via `use_lockfile = true`, so no DDB table is needed)
#   - `infra/dns` has been applied (hosted zone + ACM cert)
#   - The prod secrets file does NOT exist yet on the very first apply.
#     The KMS key is created here, then the operator encrypts a secrets
#     file against it IN THE PRIVATE ESTATE REPO (../infra-secrets, NOT
#     this public repo), then re-applies. See `infra/README.md` for the
#     full first-deploy flow.
