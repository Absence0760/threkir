/**
 * AI-coach grounded-context journey — one runner with real training
 * data (the seeded Richmond Half 2026 plan + 12 runs) walks the whole
 * "open the Coach → see what it's grounded in → ask a question → change
 * the grounding window/plan → confirm the change reaches the server"
 * loop. The thread that the per-surface specs (page.spec.ts) exercise
 * a slice at a time, threaded end to end.
 *
 * The grounding contract this pins (src/lib/coach/context.ts):
 *   - The grounded-in context strip (CoachChat.svelte header) reflects
 *     the ACTIVE plan name + its week count + the recent-runs window —
 *     this is the user's read on what the model has loaded.
 *   - The window the strip shows is the window the client POSTs:
 *     `recent_runs_limit` + `plan_id` on the /api/coach body. So
 *     switching the runs window 20 → 50, or the plan → "No plan", must
 *     change what's sent — otherwise the strip lies and the grounding
 *     is a no-op. We capture the POST body on each send and assert it.
 *   - A persisted thread loads from the backend (coach_messages, plan-
 *     scoped) so the conversation survives a reload — proven by seeding
 *     a historical thread via service-role and asserting it renders.
 *
 * The LLM is STUBBED. The real /api/coach handler streams from Anthropic
 * (flaky + costly in CI) AND is the sole writer of the assistant/user
 * coach_messages rows server-side — neither happens here. We intercept
 * the POST and reply with a hand-rolled SSE body (meta / token / done)
 * exactly as page.spec.ts does, and capture each request so the body is
 * the grounding assertion. No coach_messages row is written by a stubbed
 * send, so "persistence" is verified against the SEEDED historical thread
 * (a real backend round-trip), not against the stubbed turn.
 *
 * USER_A (runner@test.com) is the subject: it OWNS the seeded Richmond
 * Half 2026 plan (active, 12 weeks of plan_weeks) and has 12 runs, so the
 * grounded strip is fully populated with zero seeding. It's free-tier
 * (2 msg/day cap); the journey sends three stubbed messages, so the stub's
 * `meta` event raises daily_limit to 10 and get_coach_usage is pinned to 0
 * to keep the composer live across all three (the cap is server-enforced;
 * the stub never round-trips a real provider or usage write).
