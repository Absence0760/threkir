# Fundraising / donation pages on a run or event — implementation plan

> **Status:** **Built web + mobile-read (gated)** — landed 2026-06-19 (migration `20270213_001_fundraisers.sql`, ADR §167). The full code path ships behind a fail-closed prod gate (live Stripe keys unset + owner/CISO/counsel sign-off — see § Gating). **Client UI gate (2026-07-11, §223):** the whole donation surface is additionally hidden behind the fail-closed `PUBLIC_FUNDRAISING_ENABLED` flag (`src/lib/social/fundraising_flag.ts`) — unset in prod, so `FundraiserSection` renders nothing on run/event detail and the public `/fundraisers/[id]` page falls to its not-found state, and no user reaches a donate button that would 503 on the unconfigured Edge Function. Local dev + e2e set it truthy in `.env.development`. Flip it on the same day Stripe + the sign-off land. **Web:** public `/fundraisers/[id]` page (thermometer + donation feed + amount-picker → Stripe-hosted destination-charge Checkout), create/edit/close via `FundraiserEditor`, attach affordance on run-detail + event-detail. **Mobile (Android + iOS twin):** read + web-handoff card on run-detail + event-detail (donate opens the web page). The sections below were the implementation plan; they now describe shipped behaviour except where a step is explicitly deferred (e.g. mobile authoring, direct-to-charity payout). **Money-rail corrections (2026-08-28, migrations `20270620_001` + `20270620000002`, [decisions § 776](../architecture/decisions.md)):** a partial refund is now representable and both public numbers are net of it, and the donor checkout's idempotency key comes from the client so a retry cannot open a second Checkout Session — see § The money numbers, as shipped. Tracked in [roadmap.md § Planned features](../product/roadmap.md#planned-features--specced-2026-06-15).

## Goal & user value

Let a runner or club organiser attach a **charity fundraising page** to a run or a club event — a public page with a goal **thermometer** (raised vs goal), a **donation feed** (donor name + amount + optional message), and a **share** affordance. Anyone (including a logged-out stranger) can donate via Stripe-hosted Checkout; the money settles into the **fundraiser owner's** connected Stripe account via the **same destination-charge Connect rail already shipped for paid events** (`docs/features/club_events.md` slice P1 / `decisions.md §139`). This closes the gap flagged by the boston-charity-fundraiser persona ("I want to raise money for a charity tied to my marathon and show my supporters a live total"). Like paid events, the whole live-money path ships behind a **fail-closed prod gate** (Stripe live keys unset + owner+CISO+counsel sign-off), but the code path is fully written and test-mode-verified.

## What already exists to build on (verified)

The Stripe Connect destination-charge marketplace rail is **already built and shipped on web** (test-mode-verified, live-charge-unverified). Reuse it wholesale rather than building a parallel payment stack:

- **Migration `apps/backend/supabase/migrations/20261229_001_paid_events.sql`** — the model to copy: `instructor_payout_accounts` (Connect account + capability flags, `stripe_connect_account_id` revoked from client roles), the `host_can_take_payment(uuid)` SECURITY DEFINER boolean oracle, the `event_orders` ledger with **service-role-only status writes** (the `lock_event_order_status` trigger), and the `is_event_visible(uuid)` helper.
- **`instructor_payout_accounts`** table + `host_can_take_payment(p_user_id uuid)` — **reuse directly** as the donation-recipient payout account. A fundraiser owner uses the *same* user-level payout account they'd use to host paid events. No new payout table.
- **Edge Functions** (all under `apps/backend/supabase/functions/`):
  - `events-connect-onboard/` — Connect Express onboarding + `validateReturnUrl` in its `lib.ts`. **Reuse as-is** (it onboards the user, not an event).
  - `events-checkout/` + its `lib.ts` — destination-charge Checkout Session builder. **`buildCheckoutSessionParams`, `computeApplicationFeeCents`, `checkoutIdempotencyKey`, `reservationExpiry` are directly reusable**; the donation checkout is a thinner variant (no capacity, no sales window — a donation has no seat).
  - `stripe-events-webhook/` + its `lib.ts` — the **one idempotent, HMAC-verified, service-role-only** order-status writer (`verifyStripeSignature`, `orderStatusTransition`, `parseStripeEventEnvelope`, insert-first dedupe via `webhook_events`). The donation webhook extends this same function (one more `checkout.session.completed` branch keyed on order kind) rather than adding a second webhook endpoint + secret.
- **Pure helper `apps/web/src/lib/social/paid_registration.ts`** (`applicationFeeCents`, `salesCloseAt`, `registrationOpen`) — `applicationFeeCents` is reused directly for donation platform fee.
- **`apps/web/src/lib/core/data.ts`** (7937 lines) — existing payout helpers to mirror: `fetchPayoutAccount`, `startConnectOnboarding` (lines ~2284, ~2309), `startEventCheckout`, `fetchMyOrder` (~2376, ~2392).
- **Types `apps/web/src/lib/types.ts`** — `OrderStatus`, `RefundPolicy`, `EventModality` unions + `EventOrder`, `InstructorPayoutAccount`, `EventPricing` overlays already exist (lines 175-282). `host_user_id` already on `events`.
- **`webhook_events`** dedupe table (provider + event id) — reused for donation webhook idempotency.
- **Discover/social surfaces** — `apps/web/src/routes/social/+page.svelte` + `apps/web/src/lib/components/SocialDiscover.svelte` show how a public, anon-readable surface is built.
- **Run-detail web** `apps/web/src/routes/runs/[id]/+page.svelte`; **event-detail web** `apps/web/src/routes/clubs/[slug]/events/[id]/+page.svelte`; mobile `apps/mobile_android/lib/screens/run_detail_screen.dart` + `apps/mobile_android/lib/screens/event_detail_screen.dart` — the surfaces a fundraiser attaches to.

## Data model / migrations

One new migration. **Number is a placeholder — assign sequentially at landing** (e.g. `2027XXXX_001_fundraisers.sql`; latest on `main` at spec time is `20270202_001`, and the race-calendar plan also wants the next slot, so coordinate so the two don't collide).

Two new tables + two narrow unions. A fundraiser is **polymorphic over (run | event)** via a nullable-FK-pair + CHECK (exactly one set), mirroring how `event_results.run_id` / `event_orders.event_id` coexist.

```sql
-- ── fundraisers ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
create table fundraisers (
  id              uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  owner_user_id   uuid not null references auth.users on delete cascade,

create unique index fundraisers_run_uniq on fundraisers (run_id) where run_id is not null;

  is_anonymous    boolean not null default false,
  created_at      timestamptz not null default now(),
  paid_at         timestamptz,
  refunded_at     timestamptz
);

alter table donations add constraint donations_status_check
  check (status in ('pending', 'paid', 'refunded', 'failed', 'canceled'));
-- Widened twice since: `partially_refunded` by 20270620_001 (decisions § 776)
-- and `refund_failed` by 20270624000001 (decisions § 789).
alter table donations add constraint donations_amount_positive_check
  check (amount_cents > 0 and platform_fee_cents >= 0);

create unique index donations_checkout_session_idx
  on donations (stripe_checkout_session_id) where stripe_checkout_session_id is not null;
create index donations_fundraiser_paid_idx
  on donations (fundraiser_id, paid_at desc) where status = 'paid';
```

**RLS shape (copy the `event_orders` / `event_pricing` patterns from `20261229_001`):**

- `fundraisers` SELECT: **public** when the anchored run/event is itself publicly visible (`is_event_visible(event_id)` for the event case; for the run case, reuse the run-visibility predicate — anon may read a fundraiser whose run `is_public = true`). The fundraiser page is a share target, so a fundraiser on a public anchor is anon-readable. Fail-closed: a fundraiser on a private run is owner-only.
- `fundraisers` INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE: `owner_user_id = auth.uid()` **and** the caller owns the anchor (`exists run/event they own/organise`) **and** (INSERT/price-set) `host_can_take_payment(owner_user_id)` is true (trigger-enforced, copy `enforce_pricing_requires_charges`). You cannot open a money-taking fundraiser without a charges-enabled account.
- `donations` SELECT: the **paid** rows of a publicly-visible fundraiser are readable by anyone (the donation feed is public), **but only the public-safe columns** — `display_name`, `message`, `amount_cents`, `currency`, `paid_at`. Donor identity (`donor_user_id`), Stripe ids, and `owner_user_id` are **revoked from client roles** (the `stripe_connect_account_id` column-lockdown precedent). Expose the feed via a `security definer` RPC `fundraiser_feed(p_fundraiser_id)` returning only the public-safe projection of paid rows (the `get_event_meet_point` / `host_can_take_payment` pattern), and a `fundraiser_totals(p_fundraiser_id)` RPC returning `{ raised_cents, donor_count, goal_cents }` for the thermometer (a `sum`, never per-row).
- `donations` INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE: **no client policy** — service-role-only, written exclusively by the donation webhook. Copy `lock_event_order_status` verbatim as `lock_donation_status` (reject any non-service-role status write; idempotent CAS pending→paid).

**Two new narrow unions** (TS union + CHECK in lockstep; append both to `apps/web/scripts/check_constraint_unions.mjs` `PAIRS`):

```
FundraiserStatus = 'open' | 'closed'
DonationStatus   = 'pending' | 'paid' | 'partially_refunded' | 'refunded'
                 | 'refund_failed' | 'failed' | 'canceled'   -- as shipped
```

**Two codegen commands (mandatory, both outputs committed — `docs/architecture/schema_codegen.md`):**

```
cd apps/backend && npm run gen:types        # → apps/web/src/lib/database.types.ts
dart run scripts/gen_dart_models.dart       # → packages/core_models/lib/src/generated/db_rows.dart
```

(The Dart generator understands `create table` + the column lists here; it ignores the RLS/trigger/RPC bodies, which is correct — no hand-editing `db_rows.dart`.)

No new `runs.metadata` keys (relational) → no `docs/backend/metadata.md` churn.

## Web implementation (canonical)

Web-first (`decisions.md §24`). All paths under `apps/web/src/`.

**Edge Functions (new, under `apps/backend/supabase/functions/`):**
- `donations-checkout/index.ts` + `donations-checkout/lib.ts` — mirror `events-checkout` but simpler (no capacity, no sales window). Validate: fundraiser visible + `status = 'open'`; owner `host_can_take_payment`; amount within a sane min/max (e.g. 100–10_000_00 cents); donor may be **anon** (no JWT required — a donation has no seat, unlike a paid registration). Insert a `pending` `donations` row (service role), build the destination-charge session via the reused `buildCheckoutSessionParams` (destination = owner's `stripe_connect_account_id`, `application_fee_amount` from `computeApplicationFeeCents` at the `platform_fees.donation_fee_bps` rate, read as the service role — decisions § 1768), `mode: 'payment'`, metadata `{ kind: 'donation', donation_id }`. Idempotency key = `donations-checkout:{donation_id}` (the row id is generated server-side before the Stripe call). SAQ A — no card form.
- **Extend** `stripe-events-webhook/index.ts` + `lib.ts` — add a branch keyed on `session.metadata.kind === 'donation'`: CAS `pending → paid` on the `donations` row, set `paid_at`, `stripe_payment_intent_id`. `charge.refunded` → `refunded`. Reuse the existing insert-first `webhook_events` dedupe + `verifyStripeSignature`. **One webhook, one secret** — do not add a second endpoint.

**`data.ts` helpers (append to `apps/web/src/lib/core/data.ts`):**
- `fetchFundraiserForRun(runId)` / `fetchFundraiserForEvent(eventId)` → `Fundraiser | null`
- `fetchFundraiserById(id)` → public page load
- `createFundraiser(input)` / `updateFundraiser(id, patch)` / `closeFundraiser(id)`
- `fetchFundraiserTotals(id)` → `{ raisedCents, donorCount, goalCents }` (calls `fundraiser_totals` RPC). **Throws on a failed read**; `null` means the RPC answered with no rows (nothing donated yet). Both once did `if (error || !data) return null/[]`, which drew a thermometer at "0 raised · 0 supporters" over "Be the first to donate" whenever a read failed — a false claim about someone else's campaign, made to an anonymous donor (`conventions.md § A failed read is not an empty result`).
- `fetchFundraiserFeed(id, limit)` → public donation feed (calls `fundraiser_feed` RPC). **Throws on a failed read**; `[]` is a genuinely empty feed.
- `startDonationCheckout(fundraiserId, amountCents, { displayName, message, isAnonymous })` → `{ url }` (invokes `donations-checkout`)
- Reuse existing `fetchPayoutAccount` / `startConnectOnboarding`.

**types.ts overlays (`apps/web/src/lib/types.ts`):**
- `FundraiserStatus`, `DonationStatus` unions
- `Fundraiser = Omit<FundraiserRow, 'status'> & { status: FundraiserStatus }`
- `Donation = Omit<DonationRow, 'status'> & { status: DonationStatus }`
- `FundraiserFeedEntry` / `FundraiserTotals` projection interfaces (RPC row shapes)

**Routes / components (new):**
- `apps/web/src/routes/fundraisers/[id]/+page.svelte` + `+page.ts` — the **public fundraiser page**: hero (title, charity, story rendered with the existing markdown/HTML-sanitise path used elsewhere — never raw `{@html}`), **thermometer** (`GoalThermometer.svelte`, raised/goal bar with a11y `role="progressbar"` + aria-valuenow/max), **donation feed** (`DonationFeed.svelte`, name + amount + message), **"Donate" CTA** → amount picker → `startDonationCheckout` → Stripe → `?donated=1` success poll (the `<5s` poll pattern `fetchMyOrder` uses). Owner sees a Close + Edit control. The campaign row and its two panels are **three separate reads**: a panel that could not be read renders its own `role="alert"` line plus a Retry that re-reads only that panel, ahead of the panel's empty state, while the hero, story and Donate CTA stay up. `FundraiserSection` reads totals outside the campaign's `try` for the same reason — one shared catch had let a totals failure erase a live campaign down to the owner's create CTA.
- `apps/web/src/lib/components/FundraiserCard.svelte` — compact thermometer + Donate button, embedded on run-detail + event-detail.
- `apps/web/src/lib/components/FundraiserEditor.svelte` — create/edit (charity name, url, title, story, goal). A "Set up payouts first" gate that links to `/settings/payouts` and is **disabled until `host_can_take_payment`** (reuse the EventEditor Charge-toggle gate).
- **Run-detail** `apps/web/src/routes/runs/[id]/+page.svelte` — owner gets "Raise money for a charity" → FundraiserEditor; if a fundraiser exists, render `FundraiserCard` for all viewers.
- **Event-detail** `apps/web/src/routes/clubs/[slug]/events/[id]/+page.svelte` — same affordance, organiser-gated; renders `FundraiserCard`.
- **Share**: the public `/fundraisers/[id]` page is the share URL; add it to the existing share/copy-link affordance pattern (no new infra).
- **Layout gate**: `/fundraisers/` is in `isAnonAllowed()` in `apps/web/src/routes/+layout.svelte` (shell-wrapped for a signed-in viewer, like `/clubs/` — `decisions.md §62`). Anon-readability is decided at three layers and all three have to agree: the anchor-visibility RLS, the anon `execute` grants on `fundraiser_totals` / `fundraiser_feed`, and this list. It was missing from the list until 2026-08-09, so the logged-out stranger the share URL exists for was bounced to `/login` while every backend layer was already open to them — the shipped e2e ran signed-in and never saw it. `tests-e2e/fundraising/detail-load-failure.spec.ts` runs anonymously and pins the whole path.

## Mobile implementation (Android + iOS twin)

Per `decisions.md §39`, every Dart change lands **byte-identical** in `apps/mobile_android/lib/` and `apps/mobile_ios/lib/` (+ tests). Mobile is **read + share only in this slice** — donation checkout routes to the web page in a Custom Tab / in-app browser, mirroring how paid-event registration is web-checkout-only (P3 in `club_events.md`). **No in-app purchase flow, no `BYPASS_PAYWALL`-style override** (the in-person/real-world-service IAP exemption is for paid events; a charitable donation through a third party is also outside IAP, but to contain blast radius we keep mobile read-only here).

- **Service** `apps/mobile_android/lib/social_service.dart` (+ iOS twin) — add `fetchFundraiserForRun/Event`, `fetchFundraiserById`, `fetchFundraiserTotals`, `fetchFundraiserFeed`. (No `createFundraiser` on mobile in this slice — authoring is web-canonical; mobile can come in a follow-up.)
- **Screen** `apps/mobile_android/lib/screens/run_detail_screen.dart` + `event_detail_screen.dart` (+ iOS twins) — render a read-only fundraiser card (Dart `_FundraiserCard` widget: thermometer + donor feed + a "Donate on web" button that `url_launcher`-opens `/fundraisers/[id]` in a Custom Tab, the existing handoff pattern).
- **Nav placement**: none. Fundraisers are sub-surfaces of existing run-detail / event-detail screens — **no new bottom-nav destination** (the mobile shell has a hard ceiling of 4 nav tabs + the centre Log FAB = 5 slots; see `apps/mobile_android/CLAUDE.md` and `decisions.md §63` — clubs is a sub-tab of Social, not its own slot, so it does not count against the ceiling).

## TS↔Dart parity helpers

- **`fundraiser_progress`** — new parity pair: web `apps/web/src/lib/social/fundraiser_progress.ts` ↔ mobile `apps/mobile_android/lib/fundraiser_progress.dart` (+ iOS twin). Pure logic computing thermometer state from `(raisedCents, goalCents)`: `pct` (clamped 0–100, but allow display of "118% — over goal!"), `remainingCents`, and a `ThermometerState` (`'starting' | 'progressing' | 'met' | 'exceeded'`) for the bar styling/label. Deterministic, no I/O. **Matching test counts** both sides (e.g. 10 each), and add the pair to the lockstep list in the root `CLAUDE.md`.
- `applicationFeeCents` (fee math) stays in `paid_registration.ts` (web-only for now) — reused by `donations-checkout`, no Dart twin needed (mobile doesn't checkout).

## Tests (in the same commit as each piece)

- **Playwright (web, `apps/web/tests-e2e/`):**
  - `fundraising/fundraiser-create.spec.ts` — owner creates a fundraiser on a run; gated until payouts onboarded; thermometer renders at 0.
  - `fundraising/fundraiser-page-public.spec.ts` — anon can view a public fundraiser page (thermometer, feed, Donate CTA); a fundraiser on a private run is not reachable by a non-owner.
  - `fundraising/donation-checkout.spec.ts` — **Stripe test mode** end-to-end: donate with `4242…`, assert the donation appears in the feed + thermometer advances (stubs per `docs/testing/local_testing_stubs.md § Stripe Connect`).
- **pgtap (`apps/backend/supabase/tests/`):**
  - `fundraisers_rls_test.sql` — anon reads a public-anchor fundraiser; cannot read a private-anchor one; non-owner cannot insert/close; donor identity columns revoked.
  - `donations_status_lock_test.sql` — a user-JWT cannot write `donations.status` (service-role-only); feed RPC returns only public-safe columns.
  - `fundraiser_pricing_requires_charges_test.sql` — opening a fundraiser without a charges-enabled account is rejected.
- **Deno (next to the functions):**
  - `donations-checkout/lib.test.ts` — fee math, amount-bounds validation, idempotency key (mocked Stripe).
  - `stripe-events-webhook/lib.test.ts` — extend with a donation-branch idempotency test (replay = one paid donation, no double-count).
- **node:test (web pure):** `apps/web/src/lib/social/fundraiser_progress.test.ts` — thermometer math (≥10 cases).
- **Flutter (`apps/mobile_android/test/` + iOS twin):** `fundraiser_progress_test.dart` (parity-matched, ≥10), and a `run_detail_screen_test.dart` / `event_detail_screen_test.dart` widget assertion that the read-only card renders.
- **Parity:** the `fundraiser_progress` pair test counts must match across TS/Dart.

## i18n keys to add (every web locale + all mobile ARBs)

Web (`apps/web/src/lib/i18n/locales/{en,de,es,fr,ja,pt-BR}.ts`) and mobile (`apps/mobile_android/lib/l10n/app_{en,de,es,fr,ja,pt,pt_BR}.arb`). Representative keys:

- `fundraiser.title`, `fundraiser.charityName`, `fundraiser.charityUrl`, `fundraiser.goal`, `fundraiser.story`
- `fundraiser.raisedOfGoal` (`"{raised} of {goal} raised"`), `fundraiser.donorCount` (`"{count} supporters"`), `fundraiser.overGoal`
- `fundraiser.donate`, `fundraiser.donateAmount`, `fundraiser.donateAnonymously`, `fundraiser.donateMessage`, `fundraiser.thanksTitle`
- `fundraiser.createCta` (`"Raise money for a charity"`), `fundraiser.payoutsRequired`, `fundraiser.setUpPayouts`, `fundraiser.close`, `fundraiser.closed`
- `fundraiser.feedEmpty`, `fundraiser.share`, `fundraiser.anonymous`
- `fundraiser.donateOnWeb` (mobile handoff label)

## Docs to update (same turn the code lands)

- `docs/product/roadmap.md` — add a "Charity fundraising pages" row under Clubs/social, ticked web-shipped (gated).
- `docs/product/parity.md` — new row: web ✓, mobile read/share ✓ + donate ✗ (web handoff), watch ✗.
- `docs/features/club_events.md` — cross-reference: fundraising reuses the slice-P Connect rail; note the shared webhook + payout account.
- `docs/backend/api_database.md` — the two new tables, RLS, the revoked donor-identity columns, the two feed/totals RPCs.
- `docs/features/integrations.md` — Stripe Connect now also powers donations (alongside paid events).
- `docs/architecture/decisions.md` — one new ADR: *"Charity fundraising pages reuse the paid-events Stripe Connect destination-charge rail (one shared webhook + the user-level payout account); a fundraiser is polymorphic over (run | event); donation status is service-role-only; live charges are gated on the same owner+CISO+counsel sign-off + live Stripe keys as paid events."*
- Root `CLAUDE.md` — add `fundraiser_progress` to the parity-pair lockstep list.
- GDPR posture / sub-processor docs — `donations` is a new personal-data table (covered by the existing Stripe sub-processor entry; add the table to Art 20 export + Art 17 deletion, with the same financial-retention caveat as `event_orders`).

## The money numbers, as shipped

Two things the original build could not state, both corrected 2026-08-28
([decisions § 776](../architecture/decisions.md)). Neither has been run against
Stripe in any mode — the whole surface is still gated off (§ Gating).

### `raised_cents` is what the charity KEPT

`fundraiser_totals` used to sum `amount_cents` filtered on `status = 'paid'`,
and the webhook flipped `paid -> refunded` on any `charge.refunded`. A $5
goodwill refund on a $500 donation therefore removed **$500** from the public
thermometer ([§ 769](../architecture/decisions.md)). That entry stopped the
status moving on a partial refund, which overstates by the $5 instead — the
smaller of two lies, because the ledger had no third answer: no
`partially_refunded` status, no refunded-amount column.

It has both now (`20270620_001`):

- `donations.refunded_cents` holds Stripe's **cumulative** `charge.amount_refunded`
  for the charge, so the write is idempotent and order-insensitive — two
  instalments delivered out of order carry 1000 and 3000, and the larger is
  always the true total. The webhook CASes on the status it read **and** on
  `refunded_cents <= the reported total`, so a stale delivery cannot walk the
  figure back.
- `fundraiser_totals.raised_cents = sum(amount_cents - refunded_cents)` over
  `('paid', 'partially_refunded')`. `donor_count` counts the same two — a
  partially refunded donor is still a donor.
- `fundraiser_feed` shows each donor's **net** amount and includes partially
  refunded rows, because a gross figure in the feed beside a net total is two
  public numbers that do not add up.
- A fully `refunded` row is **excluded** rather than netted to zero. For a
  correctly recorded full refund those are the same number; for a row written
  before `20270620_001` (`refunded_cents = 0`, real amount unknown) netting
  would add the whole donation back to the total.
- Two CHECKs bind the column: `refunded_cents between 0 and amount_cents`, and
  `partially_refunded` implies `refunded_cents > 0`. The `lock_donation_status`
  trigger now refuses a non-service-role write to it, as it already did for
  `status`.

The one arm that deliberately differs from the event ledger:
`partially_refunded + charge.refunded(partial)` is a **self-transition** for a
donation and `null` for an order. An order records a seat and has nothing to
write on a second instalment; a donation records an amount and does.

### A refund the bank sent back

`charge.refunded` fires when a refund is **created**, not when it settles —
including one Stripe holds `pending` because our available balance does not
cover it. If the bank then rejects it, the money returns to us and Stripe emits
`refund.failed` (or `refund.updated`, or the deprecated `charge.refund.updated`
on a webhook endpoint pinned below API version `2024-10-28.acacia`; all three
are handled, gated on the **Refund's own status**, because `refund.updated` also
fires for a benign acquirer-reference update). Until `20270624000001` nothing
consumed that outcome, so `refunded_cents` stated an amount that never left and
the donation stayed off the thermometer as though the donor had been repaid.

`refund_failed` is that state, and `fundraiser_totals` excludes it exactly as it
excludes `refunded` — correct, because the money is **owed back** to the donor
rather than raised for the charity. On such a row `refunded_cents` reads as the
amount that came back to us and is owed out, which is what an operator settling
it by another route needs.

It is reachable only from `refunded`, and a failed **partial** refund still moves
no status: sending a partly-refunded donation to the excluded `refund_failed`
would drop the *whole* donation off the total including the part that was never
refunded, and subtracting this instalment from `refunded_cents` is arithmetic on
a running total, which is precisely what § 769's cumulative-figure design avoided
so that an at-least-once redelivery cannot double-apply. Understating what was
raised is the smaller, safe lie. [Decisions § 789](../architecture/decisions.md).

#### The refund itself is a row (`payment_refunds`)

Until `20270630000001` the failed-partial discrepancy existed **only** in a
`console.error`. `payment_refunds` gives it a representation without disturbing
either refusal above: one row per Stripe Refund, `stripe_refund_id` unique, its
own status from Stripe's five-value vocabulary, and exactly one parent ledger
(`donation_id` or `event_order_id`).

The thermometer then reports

```
amount_cents - refunded_cents + least(reversed, refunded_cents)
```

where `reversed` sums that donation's `failed` / `canceled` children. A reversed
refund's amount is **already inside** `refunded_cents` — `charge.refunded` fired
when the refund was created — so adding it back is not new arithmetic on a
running total; it is a second, separate total summed from rows that cannot be
counted twice. Three deliveries of one Refund upsert onto one unique key and the
figure does not move.

`refunded_cents` is deliberately **not** derived from these rows, and that is the
whole design constraint. `charge.refunded` carries a *Charge* and no refund id,
so no child row can be keyed off it; only the refund-lifecycle trio carries a
*Refund*. A refund that succeeds instantly and emits no lifecycle event leaves no
row at all, and which events an endpoint receives is dashboard configuration this
repo cannot read. Summing an incomplete set would count that refund as money the
charity kept — a bounded understatement traded for an unbounded overstatement on
a public page. The children are the authority for **reversals only**, which is
strictly additive: a reversal we never hear about leaves the § 789 behaviour
exactly as it was. [Decisions § 823](../architecture/decisions.md).

The operator worklist is one query across both money ledgers, and unlike
`where status = 'refund_failed'` it carries the amount:

```sql
select stripe_refund_id, donation_id, event_order_id, amount_cents,
       status, failure_reason, updated_at
  from payment_refunds
 where status in ('failed', 'canceled')
 order by updated_at desc;
```

**And since `20270701000001` the donor is told** ([decisions § 825](../architecture/decisions.md)). The state was an
operator worklist with no reader, and on this ledger that gap is total rather
than partial: `donations` has no client SELECT policy, so a donor cannot read
their own donation row on any surface, in any state — there is no
`my_donations` RPC, no route and no screen. An `after update of status ... when
(old.status is distinct from new.status and new.status = 'refund_failed')`
trigger writes one `refund_failed` notification, which the fan-out turns into
the inbox row, the email and both pushes in all seven locales; the notification
carries the whole sentence rather than a link, because there is nothing to link
to. The transition is the dedupe — the webhook CASes against the status it read,
so a redelivered event moves no row and announces nothing.

An **anonymous** donation (`donor_user_id` null — a donor who was never signed
in, distinct from the `is_anonymous` display flag) cannot be reached by this
rail at all: there is no account to put an inbox row on, and their only contact
point is the address they gave Stripe, which this database does not hold. The
trigger guards on the null rather than letting the insert raise 23502, because
a not-null violation inside the webhook's own UPDATE would abort it and leave
the ledger never recording the failure. Those donors stay a § 789 worklist item.

#### Reconciling pre-§769 refunds

A donation that the old whole-refund behaviour flipped to `refunded` over a
*partial* refund is **not recoverable from this database**. Nothing recorded how
much came back; the only record is at Stripe. The migration deliberately does
not backfill, which leaves the cohort exactly identifiable:

```sql
select id, amount_cents, refunded_at
  from donations
 where status = 'refunded' and refunded_cents = 0;
```

Every row that predates `20270620_001` matches, and no row written after it
does (a full refund now always writes `refunded_cents = amount_cents`). For each
one, read `amount_refunded` off the charge in the Stripe dashboard: if it is
less than the donation, the row belongs in `partially_refunded` with that
figure and the charity's total is understating by the difference. **Nil today**
— the surface has never taken a live payment — so this is a runbook item for
whenever it stops being nil, listed on the money-flow checklist in
[club_events.md § Refunds](club_events.md#refunds--cancellation-coupling).

### The donor client owns the idempotency key

`donations-checkout` built its Stripe idempotency key from a donation id minted
by `crypto.randomUUID()` **inside** the request, so no later invocation could
resolve to it. It covered the SDK's retry of one HTTP request and nothing more,
while its comment claimed a retried call reused the same session.

The key has to be derived from something that survives the retry, and the
server has nothing that does. `events-checkout` reconstructs its own from
`(buyer, event, instance)` because the buyer is authenticated; **a donor may be
anonymous**, which is the whole point of this flow, so there is no identity to
key on — and repeat giving is legitimate, so the amount is not a natural key
either. The only thing that survives is a value the client mints once per
donation attempt and re-sends.

- `idempotency_key` is a **required** body field (a UUID; missing or malformed
  is a 400). The surface has never been live, so there is no deployed caller
  to keep working and no reason to make a money-safety field optional.
- It is persisted as `donations.client_request_id` under a partial unique index
  (`20270620000002`), so two concurrent attempts carrying one key cannot both open
  a donation.
- `resolveDonationIntent` resolves it **before** the Stripe call: a pending row
  for the same request is *resumed* (the same donation id rebuilds
  byte-identical Stripe params, so Stripe replays the session already open), a
  row for a different fundraiser/amount/donor is a 409 `params_changed`, and a
  row that is no longer pending is a 409 `already_used` — reopening that one
  would charge a donor who has already paid.
- The row is written **before** the Stripe call, mirroring `events-checkout`.
  Writing it afterwards left the only record of the attempt at Stripe, where the
  next call could not find it, so a crash between the two made the retry open a
  second session against a second row. The cost is an inert `pending` row with
  no session when Stripe fails; nothing reads it, and the retry repairs it.
- Web mints the key per **amount** in `/fundraisers/[id]`, so a retry after a
  failed submit re-sends it and an edited amount gets a fresh one (the server
  would otherwise 409 the edit as `params_changed`).

## Gating / compliance

**Fail-closed, identical posture to paid events (`club_events.md` Compliance + the CLAUDE.md "compliance sign-offs gate prod, not code" rule):**

- **Build the whole code path now**, behind the gate. The gate is config, not missing code.
- `donations-checkout` returns `503 stripe_not_configured` when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is unset, and requires `STRIPE_EVENTS_ALLOWED_REDIRECTS` (reuse the events allowlist). In P1 the key must be `sk_test_`. The webhook fails closed (`503`) when `STRIPE_EVENTS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is unset.
- **Live charges require operator `sk_live_` / `whsec_` keys** (default unset) **AND** owner + CISO + counsel sign-off (new money flow, charity-fundraising regulatory surface — counsel must confirm whether platform-facilitated charitable solicitation triggers state charitable-registration rules; this is a **pre-deploy checklist item**, not a reason to leave code unwritten).
- **PCI**: Stripe-hosted Checkout only → SAQ A. **No custom card form** (hard constraint).
- **Funds-flow integrity**: webhook is the sole, idempotent, service-role-only writer of `donations.status`.
- **Privacy**: donor identity + Stripe ids revoked from client roles; the public feed shows only donor-supplied `display_name` + message + amount. An anon donor's payment-intent email never surfaces.
- Mobile is read/share-only → no IAP exposure in this slice.

## Open questions / decisions owed

1. **Platform fee on donations** — almost certainly **0 bps** (you don't skim a charity donation), but confirm. If 0, the platform-fee plumbing still exists but defaults to nothing.
2. **Charity verification** — do we verify the named charity is real, or is it free-text owner-attested (with a report path)? Free-text + report is the low-friction default; verification is a heavy follow-up. Counsel input.
3. **Where does the money actually go?** In this rail funds settle to the *fundraiser owner's* Connect account, not the charity's — i.e. the runner collects and is trusted to forward. The honest alternative (Stripe Climate-style direct-to-charity / a charity-verified Connect account) is a larger build. **Owner decision** — this changes the trust + regulatory story materially.
4. **Charitable-solicitation registration** — does platform-facilitated fundraising trigger US state charitable-registration / disclosure obligations? **Counsel** (pre-deploy gate).
5. **Should opening a fundraiser be a Pro-only perk?** Ties into `paywall.md` (same open question paid events has).
6. **Refunds** — manual via Stripe dashboard in v1 (matches paid-events P1), or do we need a buyer-facing refund path on day one? Default: manual.

## Sequencing for the implementer

1. Write the fundraisers migration (placeholder name `2027XXXX_001_fundraisers.sql` — assign the next free sequential number at landing, the `20270203_001` used in the commit-plan example is illustrative): tables, CHECKs, partial unique indexes, RLS, the `lock_donation_status` trigger, the `enforce_fundraiser_requires_charges` trigger, the `fundraiser_feed` + `fundraiser_totals` SECURITY DEFINER RPCs. Apply locally via the `safe-migration` flow.
2. Add `FundraiserStatus` / `DonationStatus` to `types.ts`; append both to `check_constraint_unions.mjs` PAIRS. Run **both** codegen commands; commit the regenerated files. Write the pgtap tests; verify they pass.
3. Build the `fundraiser_progress` parity pair (web + both Dart twins) with matched tests.
4. Build `donations-checkout` (reusing `events-checkout/lib.ts` helpers) + extend `stripe-events-webhook` with the donation branch; add Deno tests (mocked Stripe).
5. Add the `data.ts` helpers.
6. Build the public `/fundraisers/[id]` page + `GoalThermometer` / `DonationFeed` / `FundraiserCard` / `FundraiserEditor` components; wire the success-poll. Add Playwright (incl. test-mode Stripe donate).
7. Add the attach affordance to run-detail + event-detail (web).
8. Mirror the read/share card to mobile (`social_service.dart` + the two detail screens), byte-identical across both twins; add widget tests.
9. Add all i18n keys to every web locale + seven ARBs.
10. Docs sweep (roadmap, parity, api_database, club_events cross-ref, integrations, a decisions.md ADR, the CLAUDE.md parity-list entry, GDPR docs).
11. Run `/check` against the working diff before each commit; keep the live charge path fail-closed (no live keys).
