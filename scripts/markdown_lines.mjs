// The two structural questions this repo's registry guards ask of a committed
// Markdown file: where does one line end, and which lines are rows of a table.
// Both have a GFM answer, both were re-derived per guard as a regex, and both
// regexes read the document differently from the renderer a human is looking
// at.
//
// Why this exists as a module rather than as a regex inside each guard. Two
// registry guards read prose out of committed Markdown, and both graded one
// PHYSICAL line at a time — so a soft wrap, which changes nothing about what
// the document says, silently changed what they enforced.
// `check_parity_pair_registry.mjs` sliced the parity-pair bullet at its first
// newline: measured on the committed 71,208-character bullet, one wrap at the
// `gym_prs` entry hid 86 of its 99 pairs, and a pair appended on a
// continuation line was invisible with nothing reported.
// `check_parity_ios_column.mjs`'s rule 2 needed `iOS` and a cell symbol on the
// same line, so the wrapped form of the sentence it exists to catch walked
// past it — and `docs/product/parity.md` already carries 5 multi-line prose
// blocks outside the rule block, so the habit is in the document.
// decisions § 774.
//
// The table half arrived the same way and for the same reason. GFM makes the
// LEADING pipe optional exactly as it makes the trailing one optional, and a
// row written without it renders as an ordinary row — measured against
// `marked`, the `<tr>` is indistinguishable from its neighbours. Every reader
// of `docs/product/parity.md` detected a row as `line.startsWith('|')`, so such
// a row was not misgraded by one guard, it was invisible to all of them: no
// 7-cell check, no legal-symbol check, no iOS-derivation check. Worse in the
// iOS guard, whose row walk reset its header on any non-pipe line — one such
// row silently dropped the whole remainder of its table (measured: 337 rows to
// 329, still exit 0). GFM's own rule is stateful and this module implements it:
// a table opens on a header plus a delimiter row of matching width, and every
// line after it is a row until a blank line or another block. decisions § 779.
//
// Unit tests: `node --test scripts/markdown_lines.test.mjs`
