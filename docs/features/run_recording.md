## State machine

The recorder has three states. Keeping these separate is load-bearing — see the "Countdown preload" and "Crash-safe persistence" sections below.

```
idle ──prepare()──▶ prepared ──begin()──▶ recording ──stop()──▶ idle
 ▲                                              │
 └──────────────────── dispose ─────────────────┘
```

| State | `_prepared` | `_recording` | GPS stream | `_track` grows? | Elapsed ticks? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `idle` | false | false | closed | no | no |
| `prepared` | true | false | **open** | no | no |
| `recording` | true | true | open | yes | yes |

`prepare()` is async (permission check + stream subscription + foreground service startup). `begin()` is synchronous — it just flips bits and starts the 1-second elapsed-time timer. `stop()` closes the stream and returns a `Run`.

`dispose()` is **terminal**, not a return to `idle`: it clears `_prepared` / `_recording` and latches a disposed flag that blocks the GPS retry loop from ever opening a stream again, and `prepare()` on a disposed recorder throws a `StateError`. Without the latch a retry callback parked on its async service/permission precheck when `dispose()` ran would resume afterwards and re-subscribe — a position stream nothing is left to cancel, holding the GPS radio and the foreground service for the life of the process while every fix raised on the closed snapshot sink. Each run builds a fresh `RunRecorder`.

A `start()` convenience method exists that calls `prepare()` then `begin()` in sequence, for callers that don't need the split.

### Countdown preload

The app splits `prepare` and `begin` so all expensive setup happens during the 3-second countdown. When the countdown timer reaches zero, `begin()` is synchronous and the user sees the run start instantly — no visible delay for GPS warmup, foreground service spin-up, or pedometer subscription.

What runs when (`run_screen.dart`):

- **On tap Start**: `_beginCountdown` → `_maybeRequestPermission` → `_preload` (permission request is non-blocking; denial drops the run into time-only mode rather than aborting)
- **`_preload` (t=0, countdown begins)**:
  - Create `RunRecorder`, subscribe to its `snapshots` stream
  - Subscribe to the pedometer stream (gated — step counts don't accrue until state is `recording`)
  - Enable `WakelockPlus`
  - Call `_recorder.prepare()` — opens GPS, starts foreground service, subscribes to position stream. Store the returned Future in `_prepareFuture`, with a `catchError` attached **here** that parks any failure in `_prepareError` (see hardening row 9 — a listener-less future reports its error to the zone as uncaught)
- **Countdown timer ticks t=1, t=2**: UI only; no background work
- **`_begin` (t=3, countdown ends)**:
  - `await _prepareFuture`, then read `_prepareError` — if prepare failed (location services off, permission denied) `_notifyGpsUnavailable` shows a non-blocking snackbar with a Settings shortcut. The recorder is still `prepared` so the run proceeds as an indoor / time-only session: the stopwatch ticks, distance stays 0, `currentPosition` snapshots are null, and the live map falls back to "Waiting for GPS...". If GPS later becomes available via a restart the run populates normally.
  - `_recorder.backgroundLocationLimited` (Android granted only "While using the app") is **not** disclosed here. Nothing has gone wrong at run start — GPS, the map, and distance all work in the foreground — and a warning at that moment read as "recording is broken" (#784). `_begin` only clears the per-run disclosure state; the telling happens on the real event, below. Refusing that grant outright (May–Aug 2026) meant the default Android runner — the initial dialog cannot grant more than "while in use" — recorded nothing at all: no fixes, a map stuck on "Waiting for GPS", distance frozen at 0, and the run saved as indoor. See `decisions.md § 611`.
  - `_recorder.begin()` — synchronous, flips `_recording = true`, starts elapsed-time timer
  - Generate stable `_runId` (UUID) and `_runStartedAtWall` (wall clock)
  - Reset the pedometer baseline to `_latestPedometerSteps` so any steps taken during the countdown don't count toward the run
  - Start the auto-pause, GPS-lost, incremental-save, and permission watchdog timers
  - Speak the start audio cue
  - Flip state to `_ScreenState.recording`
- **App backgrounded mid-run under a foreground-only grant**: `didChangeAppLifecycleState` stamps `_leftForegroundAt` when a recording (not manually paused) run leaves the screen, and on `resumed` runs `shouldDiscloseBackgroundLocationLimit`. It requires evidence, never a guess: foreground-only grant, still recording, away for at least `kBackgroundLocationDisclosureMinAway` (15 s — one fix interval plus margin), and **no fix accepted while away** (`_lastSnapshotAt` no newer than the moment of leaving). Only then does `_notifyBackgroundLocationLimited` state what actually happened — the clock kept running, nothing already recorded was lost, the ground covered off screen was not counted — with the Settings shortcut to "Allow all the time". Once per run, and never for a run that has had no fix at all (indoor / treadmill) or one that kept receiving fixes in the background, where the claim would be false (#785). The whole path is L4: its own try/catch, so a disclosure failure cannot touch recording.

### Why snapshots are emitted during `prepared`

`_onPosition` in the recorder updates `_currentWaypoint` on every valid GPS fix regardless of whether `_recording` is true. Track append and distance accumulation are separately gated behind `_recording`. That means:

- During `prepared`: the blue dot on the live map can be drawn from the first usable fix, the elapsed time stays at `00:00`, and the track polyline stays empty.
- During `recording`: everything accumulates as normal.

The 1-second elapsed-time timer inside `begin()` emits snapshots unconditionally — it does not gate on `_currentWaypoint`. This keeps the stopwatch advancing for indoor / treadmill runs that never receive a fix. Before the first fix the snapshot carries `currentPosition: null` (the field is nullable on `RunSnapshot`), and the live map falls back to its "Waiting for GPS..." placeholder.

**After the first fix, though, the timer re-carries that same fix forever** — `_currentWaypoint` is only cleared by `prepare()`, deliberately, so the blue dot and follow-cam keep working through a signal gap. That makes `currentPosition != null` useless as a liveness signal, so the snapshot also carries `positionFixedAt`: the wall-clock time the fix was accepted. Everything that asks "is the sensor still alive" — the GPS-lost banner, the spectator ping gate, the cut-off ETA's `stale` flag — thresholds on that age, never on nullability (hardening row 20).

`RunSnapshot.positionTrusted` is the companion provenance bit: false when the fix in `currentPosition` is one the distance chain rejected (sub-threshold jitter or an implausible teleport). It still drives the blue dot; it must never advance route progress (hardening row 21).

## Data flow: recording a run

```
1.  User taps Start on the idle screen
2.  _maybeRequestPermission() — requests FINE_LOCATION + POST_NOTIFICATIONS
    (non-blocking; denial drops the run into time-only mode)
3.  _beginCountdown() flips state to countdown and starts the 1s tick timer
4.  _preload() kicks off asynchronously:
    - RunRecorder created
    - snapshots subscription attached (→ _onSnapshot)
    - Pedometer stream subscribed (counts gated on recording state)
    - Wakelock enabled
    - _recorder.prepare() flips _prepared = true, starts the GPS retry
      loop, then tries to open the GPS stream. If services or permission
      are denied it throws a typed error but _prepared stays true — the
      retry loop reopens the stream when conditions come back.
5.  GPS fixes arriving during prepared update _currentWaypoint; snapshots
    drive the blue dot; elapsed stays at 0; track stays empty. With no
    fix the map shows "Waiting for GPS..." — still fine, nothing blocks.
6.  Countdown reaches 0 → _begin() runs:
    - Awaits _prepareFuture, then surfaces any error held in _prepareError
      (→ _notifyGpsUnavailable snackbar, run still starts). The handler was
      attached back in _preload — see hardening row 9
    - _recorder.begin() flips on recording, starts Stopwatch, starts the
      1s elapsed-time timer
    - Stable _runId generated; _runStartedAtWall recorded
    - Pedometer baseline reset so countdown steps don't count
    - Auto-pause, GPS-lost, incremental-save, permission watchdog
      timers start
    - State → recording
7.  While recording:
    - Each valid GPS fix → _onPosition in the recorder:
        * Refresh _currentWaypoint (drives the blue dot)
        * Accuracy filter (>20m rejected)
        * Speed clamp — delta/dt > maxSpeedMps → rejected
        * Movement filter — delta > trackThresholdMetres → track append
          + distance accumulation
    - _emitSnapshot publishes a RunSnapshot (elapsed from Stopwatch, total
      distance, track, current position, pace, off-route, remaining route)
    - _onSnapshot in the screen updates setState, checks movement for
      auto-pause, fires off-route / pace / split TTS — plus, since #607–#609,
      the cutoff catch-up cue (distance + still-sufficient pace when the
      live_cutoff_eta projection turns tight/behind), the course-marker
      target cue (ahead/behind plan when distance-along-route crosses a
      marker carrying meta.target_elapsed_s), and the race-strategy phase
      transition cue (race_phases plan built at _begin). Every cue type is
      individually toggleable via the voice_cue_types map (settings.md) —
      editable here or on web /settings/recording, which writes the
      universal bag so the choice reaches this phone (decisions.md § 469);
      the pace alert speaks the correction amount and, under an active
      phase plan, re-anchors to the phase's target pace
    - Every 10s: _saveInProgress writes current state to runs/in_progress.json
    - Every 2s: _checkGpsHealth flips _gpsLost if the last ACCEPTED fix
      (snapshot.positionFixedAt, mirrored into _lastSnapshotAt) is stale.
      Suppressed while manually paused — the recorder drops every fix
      during a pause, so fix age says nothing about the sensor
    - Every 5s: _checkPermission polls Geolocator.checkPermission()
8.  User holds the red stop button for 800ms → _stop():
    - _recorder.stop() closes GPS, cancels the timer, stops the Stopwatch
    - Screen cancels incremental save, GPS-lost, permission, hold timers
    - Wakelock disabled
    - Final Run assembled using the stable _runId (not the recorder's
      stop-time uuid, so incremental saves and the final save share an id)
    - runStore.clearInProgress() deletes the in-progress file
    - runStore.save() writes the completed run
    - api.saveRun() pushes to Supabase if signed in; otherwise marked as
      saved offline
    - State → finished
9.  User taps Done → _discard() resets all state → _ScreenState.idle
```

## Persistence and crash recovery

`LocalRunStore` keeps two kinds of files in `runs/`:

- `<run-id>.json` — one per completed run
- `in_progress.json` — at most one, rewritten every 10 seconds during a recording

### Incremental save (`_saveInProgress` in `run_screen.dart`)

Every 10 seconds while the screen state is `recording`, the app serialises the current `Run` state into `in_progress.json`:

- `id` = `_runId` (stable, generated in `_begin`)
- `startedAt` = `_runStartedAtWall` (stable wall-clock start)
- `duration` = `_elapsed` (read from the recorder's Stopwatch via the last snapshot)
- `distanceMetres`, `track`, activity type in metadata

`_loadAll` excludes `in_progress.json` from the normal run list, so the in-progress file never pollutes history.

The driver is a fire-and-forget `Timer.periodic`, and the store's waypoint cursor is read before the isolate hop and written after it, so `saveInProgress` carries an in-flight guard: a tick that arrives while the previous write is still running is **skipped, not queued**. Nothing is lost — the cursor has not advanced, so those waypoints go out with the next tick. Without the guard two overlapping ticks re-appended the same slice and a recovered run's polyline doubled back on itself.

That guard is a `Future` rather than a bool, because it has a second job: `clearInProgress` **awaits the in-flight append before deleting the file**. The append opens in `FileMode.writeOnlyAppend`, which recreates a deleted file — so a tick still inside its `compute()` hop when the user taps Stop used to resurrect `in_progress.json` for a run that had already been saved, and the next launch offered Resume/Finish for it. Both branches end in `save()` under the same id, overwriting the completed run's file with the handful of waypoints in the phantom partial (decisions § 312).

Since [decisions § 828](../architecture/decisions.md) every other `LocalRunStore` entry point — the terminal `save`, `delete`, `update`, the remote merges, the sidecar flushes — runs on one serial chain per store directory, closing a delete that used to be undone by an in-flight save of the same id. **The in-progress path is deliberately outside that chain.** It owns `in_progress.json`, which no chained operation reads, writes, deletes or sweeps, and the in-flight guard above already makes overlapping ticks exclusive; putting it on the chain would let a 10-second recording tick queue behind a directory walk, and a write that never lands is worse than the race the chain closes. `local_run_store_write_serialisation_test.dart` pins it by holding the chain open through a `Completer` that is never completed and asserting a tick still appends, recovers and clears, with an architecture guard beside it that fails if `saveInProgress` / `clearInProgress` / `loadInProgress` ever mention the chain.

The **terminal** `LocalRunStore.save` (called from `_stop`) encodes the full `Run` — including the entire multi-day track — off the UI isolate via `compute()`, joining `saveInProgress`/`loadInProgress` in offloading heavy JSON work so finishing a 150-300k-point ultra doesn't freeze the app. The atomic tmp+rename write stays on the calling isolate. An architecture guard pins that `save` uses `compute(` and not the on-isolate `writeJsonAtomic`.

Writes go through `in_progress.json.tmp` followed by an atomic POSIX `rename`. The previous in-place `writeAsString` truncated the canonical file before writing the new payload — a process killed mid-write left a partial file behind and the run was lost. With atomic rename, a crash during the new write leaves `in_progress.json` pointing at the last-known-good checkpoint until the new file is fully flushed + renamed.

### Stop-button ordering: save before clearing the recovery file

`_stop` writes the final run to `LocalRunStore.save` **before** `clearInProgress`, and the save runs **without** an `if (!mounted) return` gate. Until May 2026 the order was reversed (`clearInProgress` → `setState(finished)` → await audio cue → `save`), which produced a multi-second window where both the in-progress recovery file and the saved run file were missing. A real run was lost when the OS killed the app during the audio cue. Architecture guards in `apps/mobile_android/test/architecture_guards_test.dart` pin both invariants:

- `_stop saves the run BEFORE clearing the in-progress recovery file`
- `_stop does not gate the local save on \`mounted\``

If the local save throws (disk full, isolate crash, plugin failure), `_stop` deliberately skips `clearInProgress` so the next launch promotes the partial via the crash-recovery path below — and skips the cloud push so a row whose authoritative copy isn't on disk doesn't diverge web from mobile.

### Recovery on next launch (`main.dart`)

Immediately after `LocalRunStore.init()` and before `runApp`, the app checks for a leftover `in_progress.json`. `evaluateInProgressPartial` returns one of three outcomes (decisions §230):

- **`resumable`** — the partial has **≥ 3 waypoints and ≥ 50 m** *and* was last saved within the 48 h `kResumableWindow` (`in_progress_saved_at`). Cold start jumps to the run screen and offers **Resume** / **Finish now** / **Discard**. Resume calls `RunRecorder.resumeSession(...)`, which re-hydrates the track, distance, prior elapsed (`_elapsedOffset`), original `startedAt`, and restored laps (`lapsFromCanonicalJson`), then continues appending to the *same* NDJSON file — one continuous run, not a second record. The dead-process gap is deliberately **not** credited to elapsed (monotonic-clock honesty). This is the fix for a multi-day ultra whose process is killed mid-run.
  The monotonic route floor (`_minMatchedSegmentIdx`, the reason distance-remaining cannot climb back up on a loop or an out-and-back) is **rebuilt** on resume by replaying the seeded track through the same closest-segment search, within a fixed projection budget. `prepare()` resets the floor to 1, so without the rebuild the resumed matcher had no memory of the ground already covered: on a route that doubles back the segment under the runner's feet is the outbound one, distance-remaining roughly doubles, and — the floor being by design never lowered — it never self-corrects.
- **`recovered`** — the partial clears the size floor but is stale (older than the window, or has no timestamp — the safe default). It's promoted to a completed run (tagged `metadata.recovered_from_crash = true`), saved via `store.save()`, and a first-frame snackbar reads *"Recovered unfinished run — X.XX km, Y min"*. "Finish now" from the resumable prompt takes this same path.
- **`discarded`** — below the size floor (filters out "tap Start then background" noise).

In the `recovered` / `discarded` cases `store.clearInProgress()` deletes the file so it can't be picked up twice; the `resumable` branch keeps the file so the recorder can keep appending to it.

### Why a stable run id matters

The id is generated in `_begin` (not at stop time) and reused through the incremental save loop and the final `_stop`. That means:

- Crash recovery produces a `Run` with the same id the app would have written at a clean stop — so cloud sync can eventually deduplicate.
- Multiple incremental saves all overwrite the same file with the same id — no orphan partials.

---

## GPS pipeline

All of this lives in `run_recorder.dart:_onPosition`.

### Stream configuration

```dart
AndroidSettings(
  accuracy: LocationAccuracy.high,
  distanceFilter: 0,  // receive every fix; filter in software
  foregroundNotificationConfig: ForegroundNotificationConfig(
    notificationTitle: 'Run in progress',
    notificationText: 'Recording your run',
    enableWakeLock: true,
  ),
)
```

The title / text above are only the *initial* state. Once recording begins, `_refreshLockScreenNotification` (run_screen, throttled to ~1 Hz) calls `RunNotificationBridge` which reposts on the same channel + id with live time / distance / pace — so the lock-screen row is live, not the static strings above. See hardening row 12.

**`distanceFilter: 0`** is intentional. The OS-level `distanceFilter` gates position emission by physical distance — a value of 3 means no position until the device has physically moved 3 m. That starves the blue dot at slow walking speeds (the marker doesn't move until 3 m of accumulated motion crosses the threshold).

With `distanceFilter: 0` we receive every fix the sensor produces (~1 Hz on most Android chips) and do all the filtering in software below, which lets the dot refresh at sensor rate while still keeping the track clean.

### iOS-specific settings

On iOS the recorder switches to `AppleSettings` inside `_platformLocationSettings` and pins two non-default values:

- **`pauseLocationUpdatesAutomatically: false`** — CLLocationManager's default is `true`, which auto-pauses the GPS the moment iOS decides the user has stopped moving (including the 30 s pause to photograph something interesting mid-run). With the default flag, the run silently freezes — fixes stop arriving, distance flat-lines, no error surfaces — exactly the failure mode the Android `whileInUse` path produced. Architecture guards in `packages/run_recorder/test/architecture_guards_test.dart` pin this so a future refactor can't quietly reintroduce the auto-pause.
- **`activityType: ActivityType.fitness`** — biases the CoreLocation power-saving heuristics for foot-paced motion instead of the default `other` (driving).

The recorder also passes `allowBackgroundLocationUpdates: true` (paired with `UIBackgroundModes:location` in Info.plist, pinned by `architecture_guards_test.dart#run_screen.dart`) and `showBackgroundLocationIndicator: false`.

### Filter chain

Every incoming `Position` goes through:

1. **Paused gate** — if `_paused`, drop (Stopwatch is also paused, so elapsed doesn't advance).
2. **Accuracy filter** — `pos.accuracy > _accuracyGateMetres` (default 20) → drop. 20 m is a compromise between rejecting urban-canyon corruption and keeping sparse fixes alive. Drops log via `debugPrint`, rate-limited to once per 5 s so an always-bad stream doesn't flood. Tightening below 20 m silently rejects realistic outdoor fixes — see [decisions.md § 21](../architecture/decisions.md).
3. **Always** update `_currentWaypoint` (blue dot).
4. **If not recording**, emit snapshot and return. Track and distance are untouched.
5. **First tracked position** — set `_lastTrackedPosition` + `_lastTrackedPositionAt`, append to track, no distance delta yet.
6. **Subsequent positions** — compute `delta` (haversine distance to last tracked position) and `dt` (seconds since last tracked). Three gates must all pass:
   - `delta > _trackThresholdMetres` — rejects jitter below the minimum-movement threshold
   - `delta < 100` — rejects implausible teleports
   - `delta / dt <= _maxSpeedMps` — rejects implausible speed. A corrupt fix implying 50 m/s on foot would otherwise inflate distance and pace.
7. If all three gates pass: append to track, add `delta` to `_distanceMetres`, update `_lastTrackedPosition` + `_lastTrackedPositionAt`.
8. **Time-based gap re-anchor** — if the gates *don't* pass but `dt >= _gpsReanchorAfterSeconds` (10 s), the hop is treated as a real GPS gap (fixes dropped under cover / in a tunnel / while backgrounded, where the runner genuinely moved > 100 m) rather than a corrupt teleport. The anchor rebases to the new fix — append to track, update `_lastTrackedPosition` + `_lastTrackedPositionAt` + `_lastTrackedElapsed` — **without** crediting the un-sampled gap distance, exactly how `resume()` nulls the anchor so the first post-resume fix re-anchors. Without this the anchor stays stale, every later `delta` only grows past 100 m, and distance freezes for the rest of the run ([#330](https://github.com/Absence0760/threkir/issues/330)). **The gap is measured on two clocks and either one may fire it**: `dt` from the GPS-reported timestamps, and the monotonic `_stopwatch`. GPS time alone left the escape unreachable whenever the device clock misbehaved — a backwards jump (NTP correction, manual change) puts `lastAt` in the future so every later `dt` is non-positive, which is *both* implausible to the speed clamp *and* below the re-anchor window; a stalled clock (every fix sharing a timestamp) froze it outright. The stopwatch cannot go backwards or stall, so the rebase now fires on real elapsed time no matter what the timestamps do — see [decisions.md § 348](../architecture/decisions.md). The teleport guard is untouched: **both** clocks must agree the gap is short for a hop to fail closed, so a zero/near-zero-dt duplicate arriving immediately is still rejected. This also makes the weak-GPS banner honest: the first good fix after a real gap both clears `_weakGps` and re-anchors, so tracking truly resumes when the "distance paused" banner clears (row 16).
9. `_emitSnapshot()` publishes the updated `RunSnapshot`.

### Per-activity tuning

`ActivityType` (`packages/core_models/lib/src/activity_type.dart`) declares the per-activity knobs:

| Activity | `gpsDistanceFilter` (m) | `minMovementMetres` (m) | `maxSpeedMps` (m/s) | Split (m) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| run | 3 | 2 | 10 | 1000 |
| walk | 3 | 2 | 5 | 1000 |
| cycle | 5 | 4 | 25 | 5000 |
| hike | 3 | 2 | 6 | 1000 |
| stroller | 3 | 2 | 9 | 1000 |

`trackThresholdMetres` in the recorder is `max(distanceFilterMetres, minMovementMetres)` — i.e. the more conservative of the two knobs.

### Advanced GPS override

A user-facing toggle (Settings > Advanced GPS, mobile_android only) overrides the per-activity knobs for higher-fidelity recording on devices with capable chips:

| Knob | Normal | Advanced GPS |
|---|---|---|
| `accuracy` | `LocationAccuracy.high` | `LocationAccuracy.best` |
| `distanceFilterMetres` | per-activity (3 or 5) | 2 |
| `minMovementMetres` | per-activity (2 or 4) | 1 |
| `accuracyGateMetres` | 20 (default) | 20 (default) |

`maxSpeedMps` stays on the per-activity value.

The accuracy gate stays at the 20 m default in both modes — it has to, because the reported `pos.accuracy` is a real-world uncertainty estimate, not a knob the OS scales down when you ask for `best`. A tighter gate silently rejects the 15–30 m fixes that consumer phones routinely produce outdoors. See [decisions.md § 21](../architecture/decisions.md).

The toggle is per-device (SharedPreferences, not synced) and applies at `RunRecorder.prepare()` time — flipping it mid-run has no effect until the next run. It's only read in `run_screen.dart:_preload`.

### Display smoothing

In `live_run_map.dart`, `_smoothTrack` applies a 1-2-3-2-1 weighted moving average to the rendered polyline. Two passes are run before feeding the `PolylineLayer` stack. This reduces visible zig-zag at walking pace. It's **display-only** — the stored run keeps the raw waypoints, so stored distance/pace and GPX export are unaffected.

Smoothing cannot correct systematic offset from the road (GPS bias, not noise). For that see the [map matching roadmap entry](../product/roadmap.md#future--map-matching-strava--nike-run-club-quality).

When a backend map-matched track exists, `run_detail_screen` renders it instead of the raw line via the pure `displayedRunTrack(run.track, _matchInfo, showRaw:)` selector. **Settings → Preferences → "Show raw GPS track"** (`Preferences.showRawTrack`, per-device, off by default) forces the raw recorded line back on for debugging / verifying the matcher; stats keep deriving from `run.track` either way. Mobile-only — web isn't a GPS-recording surface.

**Offline fallback (L4 layered resilience).** The map-match read is best-effort over the network, so it degrades gracefully when the backend is unreachable: the raw recorded track always renders (L1 — never blocked by a higher-layer failure), and the status pill shows an honest "Offline — showing raw track, will retry" state rather than a hard error or a misleading status. The read distinguishes a transport/unreachable failure from a real server verdict via `isMatchUnreachableError` (in `core_models/run_match_info.dart`) — a `failed`/`skipped` answer is authoritative and terminal, while an offline read (or a `matched` row whose gz can't download, carried as `RunMatchInfo.trackUnreachable`) is retryable. `run_detail_screen` subscribes to connectivity and re-fetches on reconnect, but the retry is **bounded + idempotent** via `shouldRetryMatchFetch`: only an unread / still-`pending` / unreachable-`matched` state re-hits the backend, so a flapping connection can't spam the read and a settled run never re-fetches. The pill display + retry gating are the pure selectors `matchPillKind` / `shouldRetryMatchFetch` (unit-tested in `core_models/test/run_match_info_test.dart`).

### NRC-style polyline

The live track is drawn as four stacked `PolylineLayer`s for a Nike-Run-Club-style glow and pace heatmap:

1. **Outermost halo** — 18 px stroke, indigo at 18% alpha
2. **Mid halo** — 10 px stroke, indigo at 35% alpha
3. **Dark underline** — 8 px stroke, deep indigo (`0xFF1E1B4B`), solid. Replaces the per-polyline border that the old single-gradient line used — a shared underline avoids visible seams at the boundaries between coalesced pace buckets on layer 4.
4. **Pace heatmap** — per-segment polylines coloured by instantaneous speed and faded by age. Built by `buildPaceSegments` in `widgets/pace_segments.dart`, cached in `LiveRunMap` by `(track.length, activity)`. See below. When `LiveRunMap.activity` is null (route preview, manual-entry runs without activity metadata) this falls back to the legacy single 6 px gradient polyline (deep indigo → pale lavender).

Rounded caps and joins are flutter_map's default.

#### Pace heatmap

Each segment (consecutive waypoint pair) is assigned two coordinates:

- **Pace bucket** (0..5, slow → fast) from its instantaneous speed in m/s. Break-points are activity-specific: running ~7:30 → 3:45 per km, walking ~16:40 → 7:35, hiking shifted slower, cycling 12 → 36 km/h. Segments without timestamps (shouldn't happen for recorded runs; guards against manual-entry imports) fall back to the slowest bucket as a safe default.
- **Age band** (0..2, oldest → newest) from its position along the track. Three bands at 1/3 boundaries give the run a "comet trail" fade: oldest segments render at 55 % alpha, mid at 80 %, newest at 100 %.

Consecutive segments sharing both coordinates are coalesced into a single `Polyline` — a 10 km run with steady pacing typically lands at ~20 polylines, a hard-hard-easy interval session at ~50. Adjacent coalesced runs share their boundary vertex so there's no visible gap at bucket transitions.

The six-colour ramp (red → orange → amber → lime → emerald → cyan) is fixed, so a steady 5:00/km pace renders the same colour across every run — you can eyeball a pace comparison between two runs by comparing hue.

Mini-test list in `test/pace_segments_test.dart` covers bucket clamping, activity-specific scaling, uniform-pace coalescing, vertex-sharing continuity, and the no-timestamp fallback.

### Blue dot interpolation

`_PulsingDot` is rendered at an `_animatedLatLng` held in `_LiveRunMapState`, not at the raw `currentPosition`. When a new position arrives via `didUpdateWidget`, a 900 ms `AnimationController` tweens `_animatedLatLng` from the previous interpolated position to the new target. The map camera (in follow mode) rides the interpolated value too, so panning and the dot stay in lockstep and the dot glides between fixes instead of hopping at sensor rate.

The first fix snaps (no animation). Same-target fixes are ignored.

### Follow-cam offset for the bottom panel

`LiveRunMap` takes a `bottomPadding` parameter in logical pixels. All programmatic camera moves go through `_moveCamera`, which passes `offset: Offset(0, -bottomPadding / 2)` to `MapController.move`. flutter_map renders the `center` at `(viewportCenter + offset)`, so a negative `dy` lifts the dot above the geometric centre — leaving it in the middle of the *visible* area above the stats panel rather than hidden behind it.

`run_screen.dart` measures the actual `CollapsiblePanel` height via `GlobalKey` + post-frame callback and passes it through every build, so when the panel collapses the camera offset shrinks and the dot re-centres in the freed space automatically.

## Pause: manual only, moving time derived

The app does **not** have live auto-pause. An earlier version did, and it was the single most bug-prone feature in the recorder — false pauses during GPS warmup, slow walking, urban-canyon signal gaps, and edge cases around the track movement threshold. Each round of hardening fixed one class of false-positive and revealed another.

Modern Strava and Nike Run Club handle this differently, and so do we: the clock runs **continuously** during a recording (except when the user explicitly taps the manual pause button), and **moving time** is computed as a *derived metric* on the finished-run screen from the GPS track.

### Manual pause

`_StatsOverlay` still has a pause/resume button. Tapping it calls `RunRecorder.pause()` / `resume()`, which stops and restarts the internal `Stopwatch`. Elapsed time stops advancing while paused. This path is deliberately explicit — the user chose to pause, so the user can unambiguously resume.

### Moving time (derived)

See `apps/mobile_android/lib/run_stats.dart`. The `movingTimeOf(List<Waypoint>)` function walks consecutive waypoint pairs:

- For each pair, compute `speed = distance / time`.
- If `speed >= 0.5 m/s` (~1.8 km/h, slower than a slow walk), count the segment's time toward moving time.
- Otherwise, exclude it (standing still or drifting at GPS-jitter speeds).

This is called once when a run finishes — in `_buildFinished` (freshly-completed run) and in `run_detail_screen` (historical runs). It's O(n) in track length, so cheap enough to run on every render without caching.

The finished-run UI shows **Time** (elapsed clock) alongside **Moving** (derived), and the **Pace** column is computed against moving time so the headline pace excludes stops. Historical runs in `run_detail_screen` get the same treatment, with a fallback to the full duration when the track is missing or too sparse (e.g. imported runs without GPS).

### What's gone

Because auto-pause is removed entirely, all of the following no longer exist: `_autoPauseCheckTimer`, `_lastMovementAt`, `_lastMovementCheckPosition`, `_autoPaused`, `_recordingStartedAt`, `_autoPauseGracePeriod`, `_autoPauseMaxSnapshotGap`, `Preferences.autoPause` (getter + setter + SharedPreferences key), and the auto-pause banner in the recording UI. Around 80 lines of code and its entire edge-case surface.

The GPS-lost banner, permission watchdog, and snapshot freshness tracking (`_lastSnapshotAt`) all remain — they serve a different purpose (observability) and don't touch the clock.

---

## Hardening

Each of these is a self-contained piece with its own purpose. Most can be tuned without touching any other part of the system — the constants live at the top of `run_screen.dart` or in `ActivityType`.

### Layering

The recording stack is organised so a failure at a higher layer cannot break a lower one. "Basics always work" is load-bearing: an indoor treadmill session with no GPS and a crashed tile layer must still show a running clock and a plausible distance.

| Layer | Depends on | Breaks if... |
|---|---|---|
| **L0 — Clock** | `Stopwatch` only | The Dart VM dies. That's it. |
| **L1a — Pedometer distance** | L0 + accelerometer | Phone lacks a step sensor. Used as the indoor-run fallback. |
| **L1b — GPS distance + pace** | L0 + location services + permission + signal | Location off, permission denied, sky blocked. Falls back to L1a. |
| **L2 — Live map tiles + polyline** | L1b + network or tile cache + `flutter_map` | Offline and no cached tiles, or a `flutter_map` crash. Caught by the error boundary (row 15) so L0/L1 stay visible. |
| **L3 — Route overlay** | L2 + a selected `Route` | Usually silent — no route, no overlay. |
| **L4 — Auxiliary effects** | Everything above + TTS + network + pedometer + BLE HR + platform channels | Individually wrapped in try/catch (row 13) so a single failure (e.g. TTS init error) doesn't bring down L0–L2. |

If you add a new feature, place it at the highest layer it actually needs. A new visual (e.g. a cadence chart) is L2 — don't wire it into the `setState` that drives L0/L1. A new alert or side-effect is L4 — wrap it in try/catch.

The rest of this page is the Flutter recorder, but the layering contract is not — the two watch clients have their own recording stacks and honour the same table. The clearest reading of it is the Apple Watch GPS banner added 2026-09-18 ([decisions § 1656](../architecture/decisions.md)): the state it reports is the ABSENCE of arriving fixes, so it is recomputed on the L0 elapsed tick rather than on the L1 stream it describes, and it runs after the elapsed write so an L4 disclosure cannot delay the clock it rides on. Its self-heal retry sits at L4 for the same reason — it can only re-issue a CoreLocation call, and the clock, the banked distance and the on-disk track are untouched whether it fires or not. Per-platform state is in [parity.md](../product/parity.md)'s `GPS self-heal retry` and `Indoor / no-GPS mode` rows.

The same rule applies to *waiting*, not only to throwing. An L1 write must not be able to queue behind work owned by a higher layer or by an unrelated store operation — which is why the in-progress recorder path sits outside `LocalRunStore`'s write chain ([§ 828](../architecture/decisions.md)) and why nothing with unbounded latency (a network call, an untimed lock) may sit inside a chained body. A tick that is merely delayed forever is indistinguishable from one that never ran.

| # | Concern | Mechanism | Constant(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Crash-safe run data | Serialise partial run to `in_progress.json` every 10 s; recover on launch if ≥ 3 waypoints and ≥ 50 m | `_incrementalSaveInterval` |
| 2 | GPS-lost awareness | Banner when the last ACCEPTED fix is > 10 s old (see row 20 — the measure is `snapshot.positionFixedAt`, not snapshot arrival). Suppressed while manually paused. | `_gpsLostThreshold` |
| 3 | Speed clamp | Drop GPS fixes implying speed > activity max | `ActivityType.maxSpeedMps` |
| 4 | Hold-to-stop | 800 ms hold with progress ring before `_stop()` fires | `_holdToStopDuration` |
| 5 | Monotonic clock | `Stopwatch`-based elapsed, immune to wall-clock jumps | — |
| 6 | Pedometer resubscribe | Exponential backoff on stream error, up to 5 retries | `_pedometerMaxRetries` |
| 7 | Permission watchdog | Poll `Geolocator.checkPermission()` every 5 s; banner if revoked | — |
| 8 | Activity-type lock | Guard in `onSelected` to reject changes unless state is idle | — |
| 9 | Indoor / no-GPS fallback | `RunRecorder.prepare` flips `_prepared` before opening the position stream and throws typed errors (`LocationServiceDisabledError` / `LocationPermissionDeniedError`) if GPS setup fails. An Android-only "While using the app" grant is NOT one of them — it opens the stream and sets `backgroundLocationLimited` for the caller to disclose (`decisions.md § 611`). `RunSnapshot.currentPosition` is nullable; the 1-second timer emits snapshots regardless of fix state. The error handler is attached to `_prepareFuture` **at assignment** in `_preload` (holding it in `_prepareError`), not at `_begin`'s `await` three seconds later: a future that completes with an error while it has no listener is reported to the zone as uncaught, so the documented indoor path used to emit a spurious error report on every occurrence (and would emit a spurious non-fatal once a crash reporter is wired up). `_begin` reads the held error and shows the non-blocking snackbar; the run proceeds as a time-only session. GPS-lost and permission-revoked banners stay dormant until the first real fix arrives, so indoor runs don't nag. | — |
| 10 | LiveRunMap restart reset | `didUpdateWidget` wipes `_animatedLatLng`, tween endpoints, and `_userPanned` when the track clears for a new run, so the next first fix snaps cleanly and the follow-cam re-centres | — |
| 11 | GPS self-heal | `_gpsRetryTimer` inside `RunRecorder` polls every 3 s while `_prepared` is true and `_positionSub` is null. Once `isLocationServiceEnabled()` + `checkPermission()` both pass, it reopens the position stream with the accuracy settings remembered from `prepare()`. The stream subscription uses `onError`/`cancelOnError: true` so an Android-side disconnect (e.g. user toggles Location off mid-run) cleanly clears `_positionSub` and the retry loop takes over. Net effect: tracking resumes automatically when Location is re-enabled, whether the run started without GPS or lost it mid-run. | `_gpsRetryInterval` |
| 12 | Live lock-screen notification (Android) | `RunNotificationBridge` (Kotlin) pre-creates `geolocator_channel_01` with `VISIBILITY_PUBLIC` + `IMPORTANCE_LOW` (winning the race against geolocator's private-visibility default, which is immutable after creation), then reposts on that channel with `BigTextStyle` + `CATEGORY_WORKOUT` so the lock-screen row shows live time / distance / pace instead of the static "Run in progress". Posts are guarded by a runtime POST_NOTIFICATIONS check (Android 13+); if missing the bridge returns an error rather than silently no-opping. The Dart side (`RunNotificationBridge`, called from `_refreshLockScreenNotification` at the end of `_onSnapshot`) throttles to ~1 Hz. Explicitly cleared on stop / discard. Constants in the bridge mirror `GeolocatorLocationService`; if a future geolocator release changes them, the replacement stops applying — fix by updating the constants. **Lock-screen controls (#14, #270):** the reposted notification carries `Pause`/`Resume` (flipped by the `paused` flag the Dart side passes on each update) + `Stop` action buttons. Each is a `PendingIntent.getBroadcast` targeting `RunActionReceiver` (a manifest-declared `BroadcastReceiver`, `exported=false`) carrying a `run_action` extra; the receiver forwards it through `RunNotificationBridge` (companion `instance`) over the same method channel to Dart, where `run_screen` maps it onto the same `_toggleManualPause` / `_stop` handlers the on-screen controls use (so a11y + UI state stay consistent). **A broadcast (not a `getActivity` MainActivity launch) is deliberate: an activity-launch `PendingIntent` trips the keyguard unlock prompt on a locked phone, forcing an unlock before the action fires (#270) — a broadcast fires without unlocking, which is the whole point of a lock-screen control.** The recording foreground service keeps the process alive during a run, so `instance` is live when the broadcast arrives; an action that arrives before Dart registers its handler is stashed natively and flushed when Dart announces `ready`. The notification body tap still opens the app via a `getActivity` intent (`openAppIntent`). The getBroadcast routing + receiver declaration are pinned by an `architecture_guards_test.dart` guard; Dart-side dispatch is unit-tested (`run_notification_bridge_test.dart`); the native IPC needs on-device verification. | — |
| 13 | Auxiliary-effect isolation | Every L4 effect inside `_onSnapshot` (workout runner, race ping, live broadcaster, off-route cue, pace alert, split snackbar + TTS, lock-screen update) is wrapped in its own try/catch + `debugPrint`, and the L0/L1 mirror-field write + `_statsNotifier.value` publish always runs **before** the first L4 try-block. A failure in any one (TTS init error, Supabase realtime drop, corrupt route math, runner step-index throw) can't break the visible stats — the L0 (clock) / L1 (distance / pace) numbers stay live even when L4 is misbehaving. The architecture guards in `apps/mobile_android/test/architecture_guards_test.dart#run_screen.dart` pin both halves of the rule (L0/L1-before-L4, and one try per effect) so a future hoist-or-collapse refactor fails CI instead of silently freezing the counters. | — |
| 14 | Pedometer distance fallback | When `_everHadGpsFix` is false and the GPS distance is 0, `_displayDistanceMetres` returns `steps × ActivityType.strideMetres` (via the pure `liveDistanceMetres` in `run_stats.dart`). Every distance-DERIVED behaviour resolves through the same getter, not just the readout — split banner / shade row / split voice cue, the split's average pace, and race-phase transitions plus the phase chip. Reading the raw recorder distance at one of those sites silently disables it for the whole of a pedometer-only session, which is what happened before 2026-07-25. UI prefixes a tilde and the indoor chip flags the estimate. On stop, `metadata.indoor_estimated = true` + `metadata.distance_source = "pedometer"` are written so downstream views can render it distinctly. Crash recovery accepts an indoor run with `duration ≥ 60 s` instead of the usual 3-waypoint / 50 m gate, so a treadmill session doesn't evaporate on recovery. | `ActivityType.strideMetres` |
| 15 | Release-build error boundary | `ErrorWidget.builder` is overridden in `main.dart` (release only — debug keeps Flutter's red screen for visibility) with a subtle "This section couldn't load" card. A crash inside `LiveRunMap` or any other subtree replaces only that subtree, leaving the stats panel and recording state intact. `RunRecorder` lives outside the widget tree, so even a full-screen rebuild doesn't stop it. | — |
| 16 | Weak-GPS disclosure | The recorder's accuracy gate drops low-accuracy fixes (tree cover / urban canyon) so distance stalls while the clock keeps ticking — which reads as a frozen app. `RunRecorder` exposes the dropped-fix state as `RunSnapshot.weakGps` (set on a gated fix, cleared the moment one passes). `run_screen` mirrors it in `_onSnapshot` (no setState — hot path) and the existing 2 s `_checkGpsHealth` timer flips an amber "Weak GPS — distance paused" L4 banner (an auxiliary disclosure, not the L3 route overlay). A full GPS-lost state (row 2) supersedes it. | `_accuracyGateMetres` |
| 17 | Split-notification hygiene (#303) | The per-split shade row (the visual twin of the split TTS + top banner, posted from the split-tick L4 block via `RunNotificationBridge.updateSplit` → native `update_split`) reposts on ONE fixed id — `SPLIT_NOTIFICATION_ID`, distinct from the geolocator ongoing-run id — so each new split replaces the previous row instead of stacking one notification per kilometre. The row is transient: never `setOngoing`, `setAutoCancel(true)`, and `setTimeoutAfter` so it dismisses itself without a manual swipe. Run start sends `clear_split` (from `_attachRecordingSideEffects`, covering fresh starts and crash-resumes) so a previous run's leftover row can't leak into the next session, and the native `clear` on stop / discard cancels the split row alongside the ongoing one. Pinned by the `architecture_guards_test.dart` split guard + `run_screen_recording_flow_test.dart`. | `SPLIT_NOTIFICATION_ID`, `SPLIT_TIMEOUT_MS` |
| 18 | Spoken cues say what the runner sees | Every cue renders through the `audio_cues.dart` spoken formatters (`formatSpokenDistance`, `formatPaceUtterance`, `splitCueDistance`), never `UnitFormat` — an engine reads "5.2 km" out as letters, and the abbreviation is not the right word in the five non-English voices. The split cue's count is derived in the RUNNER'S unit, not in kilometres: the tick interval is metres and the unit word comes from the preference, so counting one and saying the other told an imperial runner "1 mile" at 1 km. Android is additionally put in `QUEUE_ADD` (`ttsQueueModeFor`) because TextToSpeech defaults to `QUEUE_FLUSH` — a split cue landing on the same tick as an off-route or cut-off warning would drop it mid-word, while iOS `AVSpeechSynthesizer` already enqueues, so the byte-identical twin behaved differently per platform. The guided-run preview is the one cue that still interrupts, and does so explicitly. | `kTtsQueueAdd` |
| 19 | Split interval follows the unit | `ActivityType.splitIntervalMetresFor(unit)` returns a MILE (or 5 miles for cycling) for an imperial runner and a kilometre (5 km) for a metric one. A split is a landmark, not a raw distance — a flat 1 km default announced 0.6 mi / 1.2 mi / 1.9 mi to imperial runners, and the settings screen had always offered a "1 mi" preset, so only the DEFAULT ignored the preference. The returned values are exactly the presets that screen lists, so the default stays reachable after the user changes it. A user-set `Preferences.splitIntervalMetres` still overrides. | `kMetresPerMile` |
| 20 | Fix AGE, not fix presence | The 1 s timer re-emits the last accepted fix forever (`_currentWaypoint` is cleared only by `prepare()`), so "the snapshot carries a position" is true for the whole of a total blackout. `RunSnapshot.positionFixedAt` stamps when the fix was accepted; `_onSnapshot` mirrors it into `_lastSnapshotAt` and derives one `positionFresh` flag from it. That flag gates the GPS-lost banner (row 2) **and** both spectator ping paths (`RaceController.pushPing`, `LiveBroadcaster.pushPing`) — without it a runner in a tunnel got no red banner, no amber banner, a flat-lining distance, a cut-off ETA projected off a dead fix, and a spectator page showing a fresh, stationary runner via `live_freshness`. Pings stopping is the honest outcome: the `/live` page ages the last ping into its "updated N min ago" stale bucket. A manual pause also ages the fix out (the recorder drops fixes while paused), so a long aid-station stop reads as stale to spectators rather than as a live runner who stopped moving. | `_gpsLostThreshold` |
| 21 | Untrusted fixes never advance route progress | The recorder already refuses to let a rejected fix move the monotonic route floor; `RunSnapshot.positionTrusted` publishes that same bit so the screen can honour it. `_onSnapshot` keeps `_routePosition` = the last ACCEPTED fix and every route-relative consumer reads it — turn cues, the course-marker target cue, and `_cutoffEta` (via `_LiveStats.routePosition`). Previously all three re-derived `distanceAlongRoute` from the raw fix, so one multipath teleport 4 km up the course announced the next three aid stations at once and added them to `_announcedTargetMarkers`, which is never un-latched: when the runner actually reached them hours later, nothing was spoken. The blue dot still follows the raw fix. | — |
| 22 | Turn cues state the real distance | `TurnAnnouncement` carries `aheadM` (the runner's actual distance to the turn) alongside `thresholdM` (which announce slot fired), and the run screen speaks `aheadM`. The announcer also picks the TIGHTEST unfired band the runner is inside and retires the looser ones silently, instead of walking `[300, 100, 0]` and firing the first match. A route whose first turn is 120 m out used to produce "in 300 metres", "in 100 metres" and "now" in three consecutive seconds, two of them false; it now produces one honest "in 0.12 km" then "now". Same fix covers an along-route value that jumps a band width after a GPS gap. | `kTurnAnnounceThresholdsM` |
| 23 | Resume carries the split counter | `_resumeInProgress` seeds `_lastTickNotified` from the restored distance (through the same `_displayDistanceMetres` + interval resolution the live path uses). A fresh `State` starts the counter at 0, so a run resumed at 42 km announced a "42 km" split banner, shade row and voice cue within one second of the first post-resume snapshot. | — |
| + | Reentrancy guard on Start | `_startRequested` flag prevents double-taps from spawning multiple recorders | — |
| + | No live auto-pause | Clock runs continuously; "moving time" computed as a derived metric at summary time instead | — |

## Background recording

GPS continues while the app is backgrounded via an Android foreground service spun up by `geolocator_android` when `ForegroundNotificationConfig` is passed to `getPositionStream`. The service runs with these manifest entries:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
```

`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION` is required on Android 14+ for location-type foreground services. `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` is required on Android 13+ to display the service's notification at all.

The app's own `<service>` override for `com.baseflow.geolocator.GeolocatorLocationService` (declared with `tools:node="merge"`, primarily to surface `foregroundServiceType="location"` in the compiled manifest) also pins **`android:stopWithTask="false"`**. The plugin declares neither this attribute nor an `onTaskRemoved()` override, so without it swiping the app card off Recents mid-run tears down the foreground GPS service and its hosting process, and recording dies silently — data still survives via the 10 s incremental save + 48 h resumable-partial recovery, but the run has stopped and the runner isn't told. `stopWithTask="false"` keeps the service (and process) running so an active run survives the swipe. Pinned by the `stopWithTask=false` guard in `apps/mobile_android/test/architecture_guards_test.dart` (issue #250).

Practical requirements on the device:

- Location permission is best granted as **"Allow all the time"**, but **"While using the app"** is a supported recording state, not a broken one — it is what Android's first-run dialog grants, and refusing it recorded nothing at all. It records normally on screen, and geolocator's `location`-typed foreground service, started while the app is visible, usually keeps fixes arriving off screen as well; Android can still stop delivering, which "Allow all the time" is what removes. The app records under the foreground-only grant either way and discloses the limitation (`RunRecorder.backgroundLocationLimited`) on return from a background stretch that really did miss every fix, never at run start (#784 / #785, `decisions.md § 611` + `§ 630`).
- Battery optimisation must be **Unrestricted** for the app — aggressive OEM battery managers (Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei) can kill foreground services otherwise.
- A persistent notification showing live time / distance / pace (posted by `RunNotificationBridge` on geolocator's foreground-service channel) must be visible in the shade whenever recording is active. If it's absent, the foreground service (`geolocator_android`) did not start.

When the app returns from background, the Flutter UI resumes and the next snapshot repaints the screen with the latest accumulated state — no data is lost.

## Known limitations

- **Line drift onto sidewalks/verges.** Consumer phone GPS is 3–8 m accurate under open sky, worse elsewhere. Smoothing reduces jitter but cannot correct bias. The real fix is backend map matching — tracked in the [roadmap](../product/roadmap.md#future--map-matching-strava--nike-run-club-quality) as a self-hosted Valhalla / OSRM / GraphHopper deployment, post-run only.
- **Resume recording after a crash — no longer a limitation.** A recent, non-empty partial is now RESUMABLE: `evaluateInProgressPartial` hands it to the run screen, which re-hydrates the recorder via `resumeSession` and keeps appending to the SAME in-progress file and run id, so one continuous multi-day effort stays one record instead of splitting into two. Only a partial too old or too small to resume is finalized into a completed run (or dropped). The step baseline is carried across the same way — see the pedometer note in the invariant table.
- **Widget / integration test coverage.** Unit tests cover the `RunRecorder` state machine + filter chain + indoor-mode timer (~40 tests in `packages/run_recorder/test/run_recorder_test.dart`), the `movingTimeOf` helper (~15 tests in `apps/mobile_android/test/run_stats_test.dart`), and `LocalRunStore` persistence (~66 tests in `apps/mobile_android/test/local_run_store_test.dart`) — see [testing.md](../testing/testing.md) for the full list. The recording UI does have widget smoke tests now (`run_screen_test.dart`, `live_run_map_test.dart`) — they cover the initial-render surface but not a full end-to-end record flow. The GPS self-heal retry loop + typed errors thrown from `prepare()` are still not unit-tested — both would require injecting a mock `GeolocatorPlatform.instance`. The sync pipeline still has no end-to-end integration test; per-feature manual recipes in [manual_testing.md](../testing/manual_testing.md) cover that surface.
