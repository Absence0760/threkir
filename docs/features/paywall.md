## Current model: Pro subscription + optional donations

Every screen in the app is reachable by free users. The Pro tier
changes **behaviour inside the surfaces**, not access to them — there
is no Pro-only screen. `PRO_ONLY_FEATURES` in
`apps/web/src/lib/settings/features.ts` is empty today, so `isLocked()` returns
`false` for every key. The infrastructure (`<ProGate>` component,
`isLocked()` helper, `GATED_FEATURES` registry) is kept so a future
Pro-only screen is a one-line addition. See [decisions.md § 23]
(decisions.md#23-pro-tier-reintroduced-at-999mo-alongside-one-off-donations)
for why the AI Coach uses per-tier daily caps rather than a screen
gate.

What the Pro tier changes:

- **Higher AI Coach daily cap (10/day vs 2/day for free).** Both tiers
  go through the same `increment_coach_usage` RPC and the same
  `usedToday > dailyLimit` gate in `apps/web/src/lib/coach/handler.ts`;
  only the resolved cap differs. Free users get
  `TIER_LIMITS.free.dailyLimit = 2` messages per UTC day, then the
  composer is replaced by a `<div class="limit-bar">` "you've used all
  2 messages for today — Upgrade to Pro…" banner until midnight. Pro
  users get `TIER_LIMITS.pro.dailyLimit = 10` and the same limit-bar
  shape at the higher ceiling. The production AWS Lambda hardcodes
  `bypassPaywallEnabled: false`, so a caller that POSTs directly to
  `/api/coach` from devtools still gets a 429 once they exceed their
  tier's cap with `{ error: 'daily_limit', tier, limit }`. The gate is
  fail-closed: the `increment_coach_usage` RPC result is resolved through
  the pure `resolveUsageCount(data, error)` helper in `coach/limits.ts`,
  which denies (handler returns a transient 503) on an RPC error or a
  non-finite/negative count rather than defaulting the count to 0 — so an
  unenforceable cap never streams an unmetered provider call. On a
  provider failure the slot is **refunded** (`decrement_coach_usage`) only
  when the stream yielded **zero** tokens; a partial answer keeps the slot
  AND is persisted to `coach_messages` (via the same service-role writer
  the happy path uses) so what the user paid for survives a reload —
  content-persisted ⟺ slot-consumed, never a charged slot with a lost
  reply (decisions §261, issue #391).
- **Priority processing.** Pro users get a wider processing budget on
  every coach request: a 2048 max-token response (vs 768 for free) for
  longer / more thorough answers, and up to 75 runs of context per
  turn (vs 30 for free). Coupled with the higher daily cap above,
  these are concrete tier-aware budgets enforced server-side on
  `/api/coach/+server.ts` and surfaced in `X-Coach-Tier` /
  `X-RateLimit-*` response headers. Backend Edge Functions don't
  currently branch on tier beyond the shared tier-aware rate-limit
  helper; that's the next planned widening when individual functions
  get hot.

- **AI route descriptions.** On a route's detail page, every user can
  tap "Describe this route" to get an instant, offline templated
  description built from the route's stats (`localisedTemplate` in
  `$lib/routes/route_description.ts`). Pro users' tap additionally calls
  `/api/coach/route-describe`, which asks Claude (`claude-opus-4-8`,
  adaptive thinking) to turn those facts into a richer paragraph. The
  gate is server-side (`is_pro()`, fail-closed) and the enhancement is
  L4-additive: a free caller, a missing key, a model error/refusal, or a
  timeout all degrade to the templated text, so the affordance never
  breaks. A free user's response carries `upgrade:true`, which surfaces a
  one-line "Enhance with AI (Pro)" upsell linking to `/settings/upgrade`.

- **Server-side route generation** ([decisions.md §204](../architecture/decisions.md#204-server-side-route-generation-is-the-second-pro-perk-the-free-tier-keeps-the-in-browser-heuristic)).
  The engine-backed "Generate a route by distance" path
  (`/api/routes/generate` → graph_cycle + GraphHopper) requires a user
  JWT and a true `is_pro()` in the shared handler
  (`$lib/routes/generate/handler.ts`), fail-closed exactly like
  route-describe: a missing Supabase env or a failed RPC denies (500),
  never grants. Free / anonymous callers get 403
  `{error:'pro_required', upgrade:true}` **before any engine fetch** and
  the route builder falls back to its in-browser OSRM heuristic — the
  free tier keeps working loop generation, Pro gets loops traced on the
  real street graph. Order matters for honest selling: the handler
  answers **501 (engines unconfigured) before the tier gate**, so a
  deploy with the engines deferred never answers "upgrade" for a perk it
  can't deliver. The client half is `route_gen_flag.ts`
  (`PUBLIC_ROUTE_GEN_ENABLED`, fail-closed, mirrors `coach_flag.ts`): it
  gates the `/routes/new` upsell note and the Pro-card bullet. The JWT
  rides `x-supabase-authorization` (CloudFront's OAC owns
  `Authorization`); the generate-route origin request policy whitelists
  it and Terraform hands the Lambda `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` +
  `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

`/settings/upgrade` shows a two-card layout: a Pro plan card
($9.99 / month, feature bullets, "Get Pro" CTA) and a one-off Donate
button that links to an external payment provider. The transparent
cost breakdown, monthly progress bars, donor count, and tiered
donation buttons that existed under the previous donations-only model
are gone — see [decisions.md § 23](../architecture/decisions.md#23-pro-tier-reintroduced-at-999mo-alongside-one-off-donations).

**The Pro storefront is gated on a live perk** — sellable when
`coachEnabled() || routeGenEnabled()`, i.e. when either
`PUBLIC_COACH_ENABLED` (`$lib/coach/coach_flag.ts`) or
`PUBLIC_ROUTE_GEN_ENABLED` (`$lib/routes/route_gen_flag.ts`, decisions
§204) is set; both flags are fail-closed like `weigh_in_flag.ts`. On a
deploy with both perks off — the rock-bottom deploy leaves
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unset so `/api/coach` 503s, and both rock-bottom and
Lean defer the route engines so `/api/routes/generate` 501s — a Pro
subscription delivers nothing. With both flags unset the Pro card drops
its "Get Pro" CTA for a "Pro — coming soon" teaser
(`upgrade.proComingSoon`), the "Most popular" ribbon becomes
"Coming soon", and the Donate button becomes the primary CTA — so the
app never sells a hollow subscription and leads with donations instead.
Each flagged perk's card bullet is additionally gated on its own flag
(the Coach bullets on `coachOn`, the route-generation bullet on
`routeGenOn`), so a partially-live deploy (e.g. Lean: Coach on, engines
still deferred) sells Pro without advertising the dead perk. Setting
each flag true (only once its feature is actually live) restores the
full card with no code change. The tier machinery (`subscription_tier`,
`is_pro()`, `TIER_LIMITS`, RevenueCat webhook) stays intact and dormant
either way.

**Mobile mirrors the same gate** ([decisions.md § 466](../architecture/decisions.md)).
A Flutter binary has no server-rendered env, so the web build publishes
the two flags it already reads as a prerendered manifest at
**`/app-capabilities.json`** (`apps/web/src/routes/app-capabilities.json/+server.ts`,
body `{coach, route_gen}`, derived from the *same* `coachEnabled()` /
`routeGenEnabled()` gates — there is no second flag to keep in sync).
`apps/mobile_android/lib/pro_sellable.dart` (twin-mirrored) fetches it
from `WEB_BASE_URL` — the origin the app already calls for `/api/coach`
— and `SettingsProScreen` swaps the "Subscribe to Pro" tile for the
`proComingSoonTitle` / `proComingSoon` teaser when `ProPerks.sellable`
is false, exactly as web swaps in `upgrade.proComingSoon`.
**Fail-closed:** an unreachable host, a timeout, a non-200, a malformed
body, a missing field, and a truthy-but-not-boolean field all resolve to
`ProPerks.none`, and the state is unknown-therefore-not-sellable until
the manifest lands — a client that can't establish a perk is live never
takes a payment. `_startProCheckout` carries the same gate so no caller
can route around the hidden tile. **Restore purchases** and **Manage
subscription** stay reachable in both states: they aren't sales, and
Apple Guideline 3.1.1 / the Play subscription policy require them
regardless. The release workflow gives the manifest the short
HTML-style `cache-control` rather than the immutable-asset one, so a
perk switched off propagates instead of sticking in caches for a year.

The same `coachEnabled()` flag hides every other **web** entry point into
the AI Coach so rock-bottom shows no door that only 503s:

- the **Coach sidebar nav item** (`+layout.svelte` filters it out),
- the **`/coach` page chat** — replaced by a "coming soon" notice
  (`coachPage.comingSoon*`); the static guided-runs rail below it stays
  (it's local TTS cue scripts, no Anthropic dependency),
- the **dashboard "Ask the Coach" promo** card,
- the **route-detail "Enhance with AI (Pro)" upsell** (the offline
  "Describe this route" template button stays — it needs no AI),
- the **`/compare` "AI Coach" explore link**.

The human coach-athlete roster (`/coaching`) is a **separate feature** and
is NOT gated — it has no Anthropic dependency. `paywall_guards.test.ts`
pins the storefront gate so Pro can't be silently re-sold while the Coach
is off.

The `monthly_funding` table stays in the schema (orphaned but not
dropped); reviving transparent funding later is a one-page revert.

## Tiers

| Tier | How you get it | What it unlocks |
|---|---|---|
| `free` | Default for every new account | Every screen in the app. AI Coach capped at 2 messages/day. Standard request priority. Route generation via the in-browser heuristic. |
| `pro` | RevenueCat subscription ($9.99 / month) | Everything free users get + AI Coach capped at 10 messages/day (5× the free cap) + priority processing (wider context budget, longer responses) + AI route descriptions + server-side route generation (real street-graph loops, decisions §204). |
| `lifetime` | RevenueCat one-time purchase (not currently sold) | Same as `pro`. |

`user_profiles.subscription_tier` is the authoritative column. A CHECK
constraint enforces the three valid values. The `is_pro()` SQL helper
takes no arguments and gates internally on `auth.uid()`; it returns
`true` for both `pro` and `lifetime`. (An earlier `is_user_pro(uuid)`
variant was dropped in `20260516_001_drop_is_user_pro.sql` — it took a
user-id parameter and let any authenticated caller probe another user's
tier.)

The column is **write-protected against user-JWT writers**. Migration
`20260624_001_lock_subscription_tier_to_service_role.sql` splits the
catch-all profile policy into per-command policies and adds a `BEFORE
UPDATE` trigger (`lock_subscription_columns`) that rejects any
`subscription_tier` or `subscription_at` change unless the JWT role is
`service_role` (the only legitimate writer is the `revenuecat-webhook`
Edge Function) or empty (direct SQL — migrations + seed). A user
attempting to self-promote via `PATCH /rest/v1/user_profiles` gets a
403 `insufficient_privilege`. Bumping the tier outside the webhook
flow requires an admin SQL session; from a client there is no way.

## Pro gates and perks

| Perk | Feature key | Enforcement point |
|---|---|---|
| Higher AI Coach daily cap (10/day vs 2/day) | `ai_coach` | Server: `apps/web/src/lib/coach/handler.ts` checks `is_pro()` via the auth context, resolves `TIER_LIMITS[tier].dailyLimit`, and runs the same `increment_coach_usage` + `usedToday > dailyLimit` gate for both tiers. A free user's 3rd attempt of a UTC day returns 429 with `{ error: 'daily_limit', tier: 'free', limit: 2 }`; a Pro user's 11th attempt returns 429 with `{ error: 'daily_limit', tier: 'pro', limit: 10 }`. Client: `CoachChat.svelte` reads back the tier and limit from the SSE `meta` event and shows the "Free badge · N of 2 remaining" or "Pro badge · N of 10 remaining · priority context window" footer. The composer is replaced with a `.limit-bar` block when `usedToday >= dailyLimit`. |
| Priority processing — coach context | `priority_processing` | Server: `/api/coach/+server.ts` derives `tier` from `is_pro()` then resolves a `TIER_LIMITS` budget (`maxTokens`, `maxRunsLimit`, `dailyLimit`). Pro gets 2048 max-tokens + 75-runs context cap; free gets 768 + 30. Budget is echoed in `X-Coach-Tier` / `X-RateLimit-*` headers and the response body's `tier` + `limits`, so clients can render the right footer state without parsing headers. |
| AI route description | _(no key — perk, not gate)_ | Server: `apps/web/src/lib/routes/route_describe/handler.ts` verifies the JWT, gates on `is_pro()` (fail-closed: an RPC error or a free caller serves the templated text, never the model), then calls `claude-opus-4-8` (adaptive thinking, 400-token cap, 12 s timeout). Reached via `/api/coach/route-describe` (dev `+server.ts`; prod routed inside the coach Lambda by `rawPath.includes('/route-describe')`). Every failure mode — not-Pro, missing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, model error, `stop_reason:'refusal'`, empty completion, timeout — returns 200 with `{ description: <templated>, source: 'template' }`; a free caller also gets `upgrade:true`. Client: `/routes/[id]` renders `localisedTemplate` instantly, then swaps in the AI text on a `source:'ai'` 200 with an `auto_awesome` attribution. |
| AI route request (natural language → generator constraints) | _(no key — perk, not gate)_ | Server: `apps/web/src/lib/routes/route_request/handler.ts` verifies the JWT, gates on `is_pro()` **fail-closed** (an RPC error returns 503 `route assistant unavailable`; a free caller gets 403 `{ error: 'pro required', upgrade: true }` — never the model), then makes a single tool-forced `claude-opus-4-8` call that extracts a constraints object, re-validated / clamped by `validateConstraints` before it can reach the deterministic generator. Reached via `/api/coach/route-request` (dev `+server.ts`; prod routed inside the coach Lambda by `rawPath.includes('/route-request')`). The NL box is purely additive — the manual generator form keeps working on every failure mode. Client: the 403's `upgrade:true` surfaces a Pro upsell on the NL box without implying the manual form failed. |
| Priority map-matching | `priority_processing` | DB: every enqueue site for `kind='map_match'` jobs (the auto-trigger `runs_enqueue_match_job` and the manual-rematch RPC `enqueue_run_rematch`) calls `job_scheduled_at_for_user(uuid)` from migration `20260730_001`. Pro / lifetime → `now()` (front of queue); free → `now() + 30 s` (defers behind Pro). The worker's `claim_next_job` orders by `(scheduled_at, id)` so Pro jobs are always claimable strictly before free jobs enqueued at the same instant. **Future job kinds follow the same pattern** — call the helper at enqueue time; don't inline `case ... subscription_tier ...`. See [decisions.md § 57](../architecture/decisions.md#57-map-matching-is-free-queue-priority-is-the-pro-perk). |

`PRO_ONLY_FEATURES` in `features.ts` is empty today — every screen is
reachable by free users, and the Pro tier is delivered through
behaviour changes inside the surfaces. The `priority_processing` and
`ai_coach` perks above are behaviour changes, not gated screens, so
they don't call through `isLocked()`. Add a key to
`PRO_ONLY_FEATURES` to gate a new screen behind Pro.

**No feature or analytic is locked behind Pro.** Net effect of the
above: a free user reaches every screen and gets the full feature set —
training plans, VDOT / VO₂ max, training-load curves, recovery advice,
race predictor, segments, social, backup, etc. — all computed
client-side for free. The Pro tier only buys a *higher* AI-coach daily
cap, a wider coach context/response budget, and front-of-queue
map-matching. (The `apps/job_worker/internal/premium/*` Go endpoints
return `402 pro_required` for non-Pro, but **no client calls them** —
the same analytics run client-side for free, so that gate is dormant
server scaffolding, not a live paywall. If a client is ever wired to
those endpoints, this is the one place a real analytics paywall would
appear; revisit the "everything is free" claim then.)

## Client-side `isPro()` helper

`apps/web/src/lib/settings/features.ts` exports `isPro()` — reads the auth
store's cached `user_profiles.subscription_tier` and returns true for
`pro` / `lifetime`. Use it for conditional UI flourishes (a "Pro"
badge, a higher-cap label next to the coach input). Never use it as
the sole check for anything expensive: always mirror the check
server-side with the `is_pro()` RPC.

## Adding a new gated feature

1. **Register the feature.** Add an entry to `GATED_FEATURES` in
   `apps/web/src/lib/settings/features.ts`:
   ```ts
   training_plans: {
     label: 'Training Plans',
     description: 'VDOT-based plan generation with ...',
   },
   ```

2. **Server-side gate.** In the endpoint or RPC that does the expensive
   work, check the user's tier before proceeding:
   ```ts
   // SvelteKit server endpoint
   const { data: profile } = await supabase
     .from('user_profiles')
     .select('subscription_tier')
     .eq('id', userId)
     .single();
   if (profile?.subscription_tier === 'free' && env.BYPASS_PAYWALL !== 'true') {
     return new Response(JSON.stringify({
       error: 'pro_required',
       feature: 'training_plans',
       message: 'Training Plans is a Pro feature.',
     }), { status: 403 });
   }
   ```
   Or in an Edge Function:
   ```ts
   const { data } = await supabase.rpc('is_pro');
   if (!data) return new Response('Pro required', { status: 403 });
   ```

3. **Client-side gate.** Wrap the UI entry point:
   ```svelte
   {#if isLocked('training_plans')}
     <ProGate feature="training_plans" />
   {:else}
     <ActualFeatureComponent />
   {/if}
   ```
   Import `isLocked` from `$lib/settings/features` and `ProGate` from
   `$lib/components/ProGate.svelte`.

4. **Android gate.** In the Flutter app, read the tier from the
   profile and gate the feature on it. **Do not branch on
   `BYPASS_PAYWALL` in mobile code** — see the BYPASS_PAYWALL section
   below for why mobile has no env-flag bypass.
   ```dart
   final tier = api.userProfile?.subscriptionTier ?? 'free';
   if (tier == 'free') {
     // Show upgrade prompt
   }
   ```

5. **Update this doc.** Add the feature to the "Gated features" table
   above with the exact `feature` key, label, and where it's gated.

## BYPASS_PAYWALL

Two independent dev-only escape hatches: `BYPASS_PAYWALL` for the
server-side `/api/coach` daily-cap, and `PUBLIC_BYPASS_PAYWALL` for the
client-side `isLocked()` UI gate. Both stay off by default and must be
opted into per dev machine via `apps/web/.env.local`.

### Server — `BYPASS_PAYWALL` for `/api/coach`

The flag is honoured *only when all three conditions are
simultaneously true*:

1. `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` — i.e. running under `npm run dev`,
   never in a build artifact.
2. `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` contains `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` — i.e.
   the dev wrapper is talking to a local Supabase stack, not a real
   project.
3. `BYPASS_PAYWALL === 'true'` (the literal string).

Logic lives in `apps/web/src/routes/api/coach/+server.ts`. The
production AWS Lambda (`apps/web/lambda/coach/src/index.ts`)
hardcodes `bypassPaywallEnabled: false` regardless of process env, so
even if the flag leaked into the Lambda's runtime environment it
would not flip the gate. The shared handler logs a `console.warn` on
every bypass-enabled request so any prod accident shows up
immediately in CloudWatch.

The flag is intentionally **not exported** in `apps/web/.env.example`
— it should never be set in a checked-in template. Add it ad-hoc to
your own `.env.local` if you need it.

### Client — `PUBLIC_BYPASS_PAYWALL` for `isLocked()`

`apps/web/src/lib/settings/features.ts::isLocked()` already returns `false` for
every key today because `PRO_ONLY_FEATURES` is empty, so this client
bypass is dormant infrastructure. It stays in place so that the
moment a new key lands in `PRO_ONLY_FEATURES`, local devs can flip
`PUBLIC_BYPASS_PAYWALL=true` in `apps/web/.env.local` to iterate as a
free user without leaving the gate armed. Same three-condition AND as
the server flag (`import.meta.env.DEV`, local Supabase URL, literal
`'true'`), with one extra opt-out: a
`localStorage.paywall_force_locked = '1'` entry re-arms the gate for
the current page so e2e tests can exercise the lock-card path on a
machine that otherwise has the bypass on. The override is gated on
`import.meta.env.DEV` so it's inert in production.

The two flags are separate by design — leaking one (e.g. into a prod
bundle) doesn't leak the other. `PUBLIC_BYPASS_PAYWALL` is fine to
commit to `apps/web/.env.example` because the public-prefix surface is
already client-readable; `BYPASS_PAYWALL` (no prefix) stays out of any
template.

### Mobile / watch / other web endpoints

No bypass. The mobile app reads `subscription_tier` from the user's
profile and gates accordingly; for dev work flip the seed user's
tier in `apps/backend/supabase/seed.sql` to `'pro'` instead of
inventing a client-side override. The watch has no paywalled
surfaces at all.

Never re-introduce a BYPASS_PAYWALL read in mobile / watch code —
without the prod-env trio above, a stray `.env` containing
`BYPASS_PAYWALL=true` would silently disable the check in a release
build. The audit pass-2 report flagged this as a documentation gap;
this section is the corrected guidance.

## RevenueCat integration

### Server → Supabase (webhook)

`apps/backend/supabase/functions/revenuecat-webhook/index.ts` receives
events from RevenueCat's server-to-server webhook. On relevant events
(`INITIAL_PURCHASE`, `RENEWAL`, `CANCELLATION`, `EXPIRATION`, etc.) it
updates `user_profiles.subscription_tier` for the `app_user_id` (which
must be set to the Supabase user id on the client SDK).

Webhook URL (configure in RevenueCat → Integrations → Webhooks):
```
https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/revenuecat-webhook
```

Signing secret: the `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var. Set this on
both the RevenueCat dashboard and the Supabase project's function
secrets (`supabase secrets set REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...`).

### Client → RevenueCat SDK

**Web (shipped)**: the web Pro flow uses RevenueCat's **hosted-checkout
redirect**, not the embedded `@revenuecat/purchases-js` SDK. The SDK was a
top-level static import that shipped ~178 KB gzipped into the
`/settings/upgrade` bundle for two one-shot redirects; it was removed so
that weight leaves the bundle entirely (see decisions.md + followups.md
"Web bundle weight"). `apps/web/src/lib/billing/revenuecat.ts` is now a
thin env-reading shell over the pure `revenuecat_links.ts` URL builder:

- **Checkout**: `/settings/upgrade` "Get Pro" does a full-page redirect to
  the project's Web Paywall Link, `proCheckoutUrl(userId, returnUrl)` →
  `https://pay.rev.cat/<token>/<urlEncodedUserId>?redirect_url=<page>`.
  The Supabase user id is the App User ID, so RevenueCat keys the purchase
  to the identity the webhook sees. On success RevenueCat redirects back to
  `/settings/upgrade`; the `revenuecat-webhook` Edge Function flips
  `subscription_tier` server-side and the reloaded page picks up the new
  tier from the auth store.
- **Management**: "Manage subscription" opens RevenueCat's no-code customer
  portal (`managementUrl()` → `PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_WEB_PORTAL_URL`), which
  authenticates the user by email at the portal — no per-user SDK
  `getCustomerInfo()` call.

Env-gated by `PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_WEB_CHECKOUT_URL` (the portal URL is
optional): an unconfigured build reports `configured = false` and the CTAs
fall back to the "coming soon" / "manage where you started it" toasts so
local dev and previews still compile and stay usable end-to-end.

**Android (Flutter)**: use `purchases_flutter` package. Initialise in
`main.dart` after sign-in with the user id as `appUserId`. The
`PurchasesConfiguration` object takes the RevenueCat API key from
the `.env.local` file.

**Wear OS (Kotlin)**: Wear OS doesn't support in-app purchases. The
watch inherits the phone's subscription via the paired Supabase session
(same `user_id` → same `subscription_tier`).

**Apple Watch (Swift)**: same — inherits from the phone's session.

### Secrets

| Secret | Where | What |
|---|---|---|
| `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Supabase function env | HMAC signing secret from RevenueCat |
| `REVENUECAT_API_KEY_IOS` | iOS app `.env` / CI secrets | RevenueCat project API key for iOS |
| `REVENUECAT_API_KEY_ANDROID` | Android app `.env` / CI secrets | RevenueCat project API key for Android |
| `PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_WEB_CHECKOUT_URL` | `apps/web/.env.local` / CI public env | Hosted Web Paywall Link base `https://pay.rev.cat/<token>` (read by `$lib/billing/revenuecat.ts`); unset → Pro CTA falls back to placeholder. **Public** — no secret/API key ships in the web bundle anymore |
| `PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_WEB_PORTAL_URL` | `apps/web/.env.local` / CI public env | No-code customer-portal link for managing/cancelling a web subscription; optional, unset → "Manage subscription" shows a hint |

### Regional availability & international payments

**RevenueCat is not the payment processor.** On mobile it sits on top of **Apple StoreKit** (App Store) and **Google Play Billing**; the charge runs through the buyer's Apple ID / Google account. That makes cross-border purchases work *for free* — but only once the store-side configuration exists. The split is:

- **Handled by Apple / Google (no work for us):** local currency + payment methods (e.g. UPI / net-banking / cards / carrier billing in India), currency conversion, and — critically — **tax as merchant of record** (Apple/Google collect + remit GST/VAT/sales tax per territory; we never file foreign tax for IAP). They also own refunds and the auto-renewal mechanics. We're paid out in our configured currency after their 15–30% cut.
- **The buyer always sees their store-localized price**, not a hard-coded USD figure. The mobile Subscribe tile reads it via `proMonthlyPriceString` → `storeProduct.priceString` (`apps/mobile_android/lib/screens/settings_pro_screen.dart` + iOS twin), falling back to the `$9.99` USD list price + a "billed in USD" note only when RevenueCat is unconfigured or the offering hasn't loaded. Apple Guideline 3.1.1 / the Play subscription policy require the displayed amount to come from the store (it varies by territory), which is why the price is never hard-coded.

**Operator prerequisites — a purchase from (say) India only succeeds when all of these are set up (none are code):**

1. **Storefront availability.** The app *and* the subscription product must be enabled for the buyer's country (App Store Connect → Availability; Play Console → Countries/regions). Excluding a country silently makes Pro unbuyable there — this is the most common gap, so any "is Pro reachable in country X?" check starts here. (`/audit/regional-availability` exercises this.)
2. **Per-region price.** Apple via a price tier (auto-generates the local amount per storefront) or a custom per-region price; Play via per-country pricing. RevenueCat just reports whatever the store says.
3. **RC project provisioned** — the `pro_monthly` package + `REVENUECAT_API_KEY_*` (followups.md §#9). Until then the tile falls through to the web URL.

**Caveats:**

- **The web Stripe path is a separate story.** When RevenueCat is unconfigured the app routes to `/settings/upgrade` (Stripe), which has its own international constraints — notably India's RBI e-mandate rules for recurring charges and Stripe-India entity requirements. That is *not* solved by the IAP path above.
- **iOS effectively requires IAP for the Pro subscription** (Guideline 3.1.1 forbids routing users to an external processor for digital goods), so on iOS the RevenueCat → StoreKit path is mandatory, not optional. The app enforces it: `lib/store_links.dart`'s `webPaymentLinksAllowed()` is false on iOS, so an iOS build with no `REVENUECAT_API_KEY_IOS` shows the Pro teaser instead of a web checkout, the Support (donate) tile is not rendered, and "Manage subscription" falls back to Apple's subscription page rather than `/settings/upgrade` ([decisions § 1700](../architecture/decisions.md)). Play has similar rules with narrower external-link exceptions.
- **Auto-renewal in India** broke ecosystem-wide under the 2021–22 RBI mandate rules; Apple and Google now implement compliant recurring billing *inside* IAP — another reason to go through them rather than a self-hosted recurring charge in those markets.

## One-off donation flow (user perspective)

1. User navigates to `/settings/upgrade` (linked from sidebar and
   settings layout).
2. Page shows the two-card layout: Pro plan card ($9.99 / month) plus
   a one-off **Donate** button.
3. Tapping Donate opens an external payment link in a new tab.

The tiered donation picker, transparent cost breakdown, progress bars,
and donor count that existed under the previous donations-only model
were removed when the Pro tier was reintroduced — see
[decisions.md § 23](../architecture/decisions.md#23-pro-tier-reintroduced-at-999mo-alongside-one-off-donations).
The `monthly_funding` table is retained but no longer read by the UI.

## Payment flow (retained for future re-gating)

If features are re-gated behind a paywall:

1. User taps a locked feature → sees the `<ProGate>` card.
2. Taps "Upgrade" → navigates to `/settings/upgrade`.
3. RevenueCat SDK presents the native payment flow (Play Store / App
   Store / Stripe for web).
4. On success, RevenueCat fires the webhook → Edge Function updates
   `subscription_tier` → client refetches profile → feature unlocks.

Latency between payment and unlock is typically <5 seconds. If the
webhook is slow, the client can poll `user_profiles.subscription_tier`
every 3 seconds for up to 30 seconds as a fallback.
