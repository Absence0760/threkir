## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Flutter | 3.47.0 | `flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install` |
| Dart | bundled with Flutter | — |
| Melos | 7.8.2 | `dart pub global activate melos 7.8.2` |
| Node.js | 24.20.0 | `nodejs.org`, or `asdf install` — see below |
| Xcode | 15+ | Mac App Store (macOS only) |
| Android Studio | Hedgehog+ | `developer.android.com/studio` |

The first three are **exact versions, not floors**, and
`scripts/check_toolchain_pins.mjs` reads this table against the places the repo
pins them — `env.FLUTTER_VERSION` in every workflow, `pubspec.lock`, and every
`actions/setup-node` step. It said 3.19+, 7.x and Node 20 LTS against a CI
running 3.47.0, 7.8.2 and 24.20.0 until [§ 1536](decisions.md); a prerequisite
table is a pin like any other and was simply the one nothing compared.

**Every row is in one of two states, and a new row must declare which**
([§ 1587](decisions.md)). If the repo pins the tool somewhere a guard can read,
the row states that **exact version** and is added to `PREREQ_ROWS` naming the
pin — the guard then fails when the two disagree. If nothing in the repo pins
it, the row states a **floor** (`15+`) and is added to `PREREQ_UNPINNED` with
the reason no pin exists. A row in neither register is unread, which is how the
three above drifted; the guard now fails on one, and fails on a floor row that
states an exact version, since an exact version nothing compares is the one kind
of pin that cannot go stale loudly.

Xcode and Android Studio are floors because there is genuinely nothing to
compare them to, re-checked 2026-09-08: `release-ios.yml` and the watchOS jobs
run on `macos-latest` and take whatever Xcode that image ships (the repo holds
no `xcode-select`, `DEVELOPER_DIR` or `xcode-version` anywhere), and no workflow
names an Android Studio version at all. The Gradle plugin (`settings.gradle.kts`
— 8.13.2 for the Flutter host, 9.4.0 for Wear OS) and the JDK
(`actions/setup-java`) **are** pinned, but they are build inputs the wrapper
resolves rather than the IDE this row tells a contributor to install, so neither
belongs in the Android Studio cell.

**`.tool-versions` is a pin REGISTRY, not an install manifest.** Six of its
seven lines are commented on purpose: Flutter, Rust, Go, Terraform, Deno and
Python are each installed by their own manager (the Flutter SDK from
flutter.dev, `rustup`, the distro's Go, `tfenv`, Deno's installer), and having
`asdf install` materialise a second copy of any of them is not what anyone
wants. `nodejs` is the one active line because Node is the one toolchain here
with no other manager. Every line is checked against the repo's own pin whether
commented or not ([§ 911](decisions.md)) — a commented pin is a claim the next
reader will uncomment.

---

## Initial setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/run-app.git
cd run-app

# Bootstrap Flutter workspace — links local packages, fetches dependencies
melos bootstrap

# Install web app dependencies
cd apps/web && pnpm install && cd ../..

# Verify everything is wired up (use `melos exec`, not `melos run` —
# Melos 7's per-script lookup is broken; see root CLAUDE.md gotcha)
melos exec -- dart analyze
cd apps/web && pnpm check
```

## Melos workspace config

```yaml
# melos.yaml
name: run-app

packages:
  - apps/mobile_ios
  - apps/mobile_android
  - apps/watch_wear
  - packages/**

command:
  bootstrap:
    usePubspecOverrides: true   # links local packages without publishing

scripts:
  # Run all tests across all packages
  test:
    run: melos exec -- flutter test
    description: Run tests in all Flutter packages

  # Analyse all packages
  analyze:
    run: melos exec -- flutter analyze
    description: Dart analysis across all packages

  # Build individual targets
  build:ios:
    run: flutter build ipa --no-codesign
    packageFilters:
      scope: mobile_ios

  build:android:
    run: flutter build appbundle
    packageFilters:
      scope: mobile_android

  # watch_wear is NOT a Melos package — it's pure Kotlin / Compose-for-Wear
  # with its own Gradle build (decisions.md §15). Build it with:
  #   cd apps/watch_wear/android && ./gradlew assembleDebug

  # Format all Dart code
  format:
    run: melos exec -- dart format .
```

---

## Web app package management

The web app lives outside Melos (different language) but in the same Git repo. It uses **pnpm** as its package manager (matching the upstream web template).

```bash
# Install web app dependencies
cd apps/web
pnpm install
```

---

## Running each app locally

Root-level `pnpm` shortcuts wrap the per-app commands so the common cases are one line from the repo root. Run `pnpm run` to see the full list; the groups are:

- `dev:core` — quick core stack (Supabase + tiles + Ollama check + adb reverse)
- `dev:full` — the full backend in one shot (the `dev:core` stack **plus** the Go job worker, backgrounded, and the OSRM / GraphHopper engines when their graphs are built); then run a `dev:run:*` for your platform. `dev:full:status` / `:logs` / `:down` manage it
- `dev:db:*` — supabase local stack (`up`, `down`, `reset`, `status`, `studio`, `mailpit`, `psql`, `logs`)
- `dev:run:*` — `web`, `web:preview`, `fns`, `android`, `ios`, `worker`, `osrm`
- `emu:android:*` / `emu:ios:*` — Android emulator / iOS simulator helpers (`emu:ios:*` are macOS-only)
- `watch:*` — custom-watch firmware (`doctor`, `build`, `test`, `flash`, `logs`, `sim`, `sim:gui` — thin aliases for `bin/watch-*.sh`; `test` and `sim` need no board)
- `build:*` — `web`, `android`, `ios`, `worker`
- `check:*` / `gen:*` / `test:*` — analyzers, type generators, test runners
- `setup:install` / `setup:flutter` — first-time bootstrap

The per-app recipes below show what each shortcut wraps, plus the device-targeting flags you'll usually want.

### iOS app

```bash
# From the repo root:
pnpm dev:run:ios            # wraps `cd apps/mobile_ios && flutter run`

# Or target a specific simulator (macOS-only):
pnpm emu:ios:list           # wraps `xcrun simctl list devices available`
pnpm emu:ios:launch         # wraps `flutter emulators --launch apple_ios_simulator`
cd apps/mobile_ios && flutter devices
cd apps/mobile_ios && flutter run -d {device-id}
```

### Android app

```bash
# Start an emulator first:
pnpm emu:android:list
pnpm emu:android:launch Pixel_8_API_34

# Then run:
pnpm dev:run:android        # wraps `cd apps/mobile_android && flutter run`
```

### Apple Watch app

```bash
# Open Xcode project directly
open apps/watch_ios/WatchApp.xcodeproj

# Select scheme: WatchApp
# Select destination: Apple Watch simulator paired with your iOS simulator
# Cmd+R to run
```

The watch app must be run alongside the iOS app — use the "Run" scheme that launches both. In Xcode: Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme → add the iOS app as a pre-action.

### Wear OS app

Native Kotlin + Compose-for-Wear, not Flutter — open in Android Studio:

```bash
# Start a Wear OS emulator (Device Manager → Create → Wear OS Large Round, API 34)
# Then in Android Studio: open apps/watch_wear and Run.
```

### Custom watch firmware

Rust + Embassy, research-tier ([decisions.md § 71/§ 80](decisions.md)) — no Melos, no npm workspace, just cargo behind the `bin/watch-*.sh` wrappers:

```bash
pnpm watch:doctor           # once per machine: verify toolchain + board detection
pnpm watch:flash            # build + flash a connected nRF52840 DK + stream defmt logs
pnpm watch:test             # host-side unit tests, no board
pnpm watch:sim              # boot the firmware on an emulated DK (Renode), no board
pnpm watch:sim:gui          # same, plus the live watch-screen window
pnpm watch:monitor          # second terminal: interactive Renode monitor (runMacro $btn1..4)
```

Full walkthrough in [apps/custom_watch/local_testing.md](../../apps/custom_watch/local_testing.md).

### Web app

```bash
# First time only:
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
# Fill in PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY

pnpm setup:install          # workspace bootstrap
pnpm dev:run:web            # wraps `pnpm -C apps/web dev`, opens http://localhost:7777
pnpm dev:run:web:preview    # built site on http://localhost:8888
```

### Backend (Edge Functions)

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI (Fedora: RPM from GitHub releases per ~/CLAUDE.md;
# macOS: `brew install supabase/tap/supabase`)

pnpm dev:db:up              # wraps `cd apps/backend && supabase start` —
                            # brings up Postgres + Auth + Storage + Studio
pnpm dev:run:fns            # wraps `supabase functions serve --env-file .env.local`

# Functions available at http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/{function-name}
# Studio UI: pnpm dev:db:studio   (http://127.0.0.1:54323)
# Mail catcher: pnpm dev:db:mailpit (http://127.0.0.1:54324)
# psql shell: pnpm dev:db:psql
# Reset to a clean seed: pnpm dev:db:reset
```

### Job worker (Go)

```bash
# Local Supabase must be up first:
pnpm dev:db:up
pnpm dev:run:worker         # wraps `cd apps/job_worker && go run .`
pnpm dev:run:osrm           # optional: docker-compose the local OSRM stack
```

---

## Environment variables

### Flutter apps

Environment variables for Flutter are injected at build time via `--dart-define`. Never hardcode keys in source.

```bash
flutter run \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ... \
  --dart-define=MAPTILER_KEY=your-maptiler-key
```

For local development, create a `launch.json` in VS Code or a run configuration in Android Studio with these values pre-filled.

```json
// .vscode/launch.json
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "iOS (dev)",
      "type": "dart",
      "program": "apps/mobile_ios/lib/main.dart",
      "args": [
        "--dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=${env:SUPABASE_URL}",
        "--dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=${env:SUPABASE_ANON_KEY}",
        "--dart-define=MAPTILER_KEY=${env:MAPTILER_KEY}"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Web app

```bash
# apps/web/.env.local
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY=your-maptiler-key
STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=12345
STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=abc...   # server-side only — no PUBLIC_ prefix
```

### Edge Functions

```bash
# apps/backend/.env.local (used by supabase functions serve)
STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=12345
STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=abc...
PARKRUN_USER_AGENT=RunApp/1.0 (contact@threkir.com)
```

### GitHub Actions secrets

CI needs **no** Supabase secrets: every CI job boots the local stack and
derives its keys from `supabase status` (there is deliberately no
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` repo secret — see the 2026-07-20 incident
notes in `reviews/`). Repo secrets exist only for the release workflows:

| Secret | Used by |
|---|---|
| `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN_PROD` | Web deployment — IAM role assumed via OIDC when a `web@*` GitHub Release is published (see [releasing.md § Web (AWS deploy)](../ops/releasing.md#web-aws-deploy)) |
| `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN_PREVIEW` | Web deployment — same shape for the preview env (push to `main`) |
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY` | Web build — inlined into `apps/web/.env` (deliberately not `.env.production`; see the comment in `release-web.yml`) before `npm run build` |
| `PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_WEB_CHECKOUT_URL`, `PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_WEB_PORTAL_URL`, `PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`, `PUBLIC_COACH_ENABLED`, `PUBLIC_ROUTE_GEN_ENABLED`, `PUBLIC_LIVE_HUB_URL` | Web build, optional — unset values inline as empty and each surface degrades (Pro not sold, no Sentry, Supabase Realtime live path) |
| `FLY_API_TOKEN` | `worker@*` / `osrm@*` / `graph-cycle@*` release workflows |

A stale bare `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` (pre-dating the prod/preview split)
may still exist in the repo settings; nothing reads it — delete on sight.

## Package dependency graph

Each Flutter app imports from shared packages. Packages do not import from apps.

```
mobile_ios ──────┐
mobile_android ──┤──→ ui_kit ──→ core_models
watch_wear ──────┘         └──→ gpx_parser
                           └──→ run_recorder ──→ core_models
                           └──→ api_client ──→ core_models
```

The web app (`apps/web`) has no dependency on Dart packages — it calls the Supabase REST API directly via the JavaScript client.

### Adding a new shared package

```bash
# 1. Create the package
flutter create --template=package packages/my_package

# 2. Add to consuming app's pubspec.yaml
# apps/mobile_ios/pubspec.yaml
dependencies:
  my_package:
    path: ../../packages/my_package

# 3. Re-bootstrap to link it
melos bootstrap
```

---

## Code style and lint

### Dart / Flutter

All packages share a single `analysis_options.yaml` at the repo root, included by reference in each package.

```yaml
# analysis_options.yaml (root)
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  rules:
    prefer_single_quotes: true
    require_trailing_commas: true
    sort_pub_dependencies: true
    always_use_package_imports: true
```

```yaml
# packages/core_models/analysis_options.yaml
include: ../../analysis_options.yaml
```

### TypeScript / SvelteKit

Type checking is handled by `svelte-check`:

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm check        # Type-check all Svelte and TypeScript files
pnpm check:watch  # Watch mode
```

Svelte 5 runes syntax (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`) is used throughout — not the legacy options API.

---

## CI/CD

Full pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which is the full list. The load-bearing jobs, all of them running on every PR + push to `main`:

| Job | Runner | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `test-packages` | ubuntu-latest | `melos bootstrap` → scoped `flutter test` on `run_recorder` + `mobile_android` + `api_client` + `gpx_parser` |
| `test-worker` | ubuntu-latest | `go vet ./...` + `go test ./...` for `apps/job_worker` (incl. the GDPR Art 20 export-completeness guard) |
| `test-graph-cycle` | ubuntu-latest | `go vet ./...` + `go test ./...` for the `apps/graph_cycle` street-graph cycle-search sidecar |
| `parity-types` | ubuntu-latest | migration version-key + online-safety guards, `check_pnpm_overrides.mjs` (the security pins are declared in both lockfiles and actually resolved to, [§ 730](decisions.md)), `sync_deno_lock.mjs --check` ([§ 706](decisions.md)), `check_constraint_unions.mjs`, the web TS unit suite, the four `apps/web` tsc roots + their coverage guard ([§ 749](decisions.md) / [§ 752](decisions.md)), the two repo-root tsc roots + their coverage guard (`check:script-types`, `check:cloudfront-types`, `check:tsconfig-coverage` — [§ 757](decisions.md)), then `supabase start` → `npm run gen:types:check`. Every step prints its own `::error::` — the job name covers more than type drift, so it cannot say which one broke ([decisions.md § 711](decisions.md)) |
| `build-web` | ubuntu-latest | `npm run build --workspace=apps/web` — SvelteKit compile check, no deploy |
| `env-isolation` | ubuntu-latest | the dev-env guard's suite (`env_isolation.test.mjs`), the release-build env guard's suite (`check_production_env.test.mjs`), and a scan of every committed `.env.example` / `.env.development` for a live Stripe / Anthropic / Supabase value. Install-free, stdlib only. Was `env-isolation.yml`, a workflow of its own on a path filter and therefore in no `needs:` of the gate ([§ 862](decisions.md)) |
| `parity-matrix` | ubuntu-latest | `dart run scripts/check_parity_matrix.dart` (table structure + legal symbols) and `node scripts/check_parity_ios_column.mjs` (the iOS column matches the one rule the doc states for it, decisions § 739) — keeps `docs/product/parity.md` honest. Ungated: a parity.md edit is a docs-only diff, so a guard for it in a `code`-gated job would never run |
| `build-watch-wear` | ubuntu-latest | `./gradlew assembleDebug testDebugUnitTest` in `apps/watch_wear/android` — the Compose-for-Wear smoke build AND the 816 `@Test` methods it carries, which hang on that second task word alone. `scripts/check_gradle_test_coverage.mjs` in `workflow-lint` reads the task list handed to Gradle, so deleting the word fails the PR ([§ 1393](decisions.md)). **No workflow declares `GRADLE_UNTESTED` any more** — [§ 1439](decisions.md) wired up the last excused project and deleted both the value and the step that echoed it, and the guard treats an absent declaration as the empty list it is meant to end at ([§ 1500](decisions.md)). Should one ever come back, it is a `<path>=<count>=<reason>` value that a `run:` step in the declaring job must print, which the guard now requires rather than assumes ([§ 1533](decisions.md)) |
| `build-firmware` | ubuntu-latest | `cargo build` + clippy + host tests of `apps/custom_watch` (Rust + Embassy, `thumbv7em-none-eabihf`); build + `clippy -D warnings` run over three feature sets — default, `ble` (`--no-default-features`), and the sim set — so the off-by-default builds can't rot |
| `build-mobile-android` | ubuntu-latest | `flutter build apk --release --no-tree-shake-icons --target-platform android-arm64` in `apps/mobile_android` — a toolchain smoke test, not a shipped artifact (the AAB is built on tag by `release-android.yml`). It configures and assembles the whole `android/` Gradle host, so an AGP / KGP / plugin-subproject break surfaces here rather than at a release tag; then a second step runs `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest` in the same directory, which is where that project's 32 `@Test` methods execute — `assembleRelease` has no dependency on a test task, so until [§ 1439](decisions.md) committed the wrapper and added that step they ran nowhere. The `:app:` qualifier is load-bearing: unqualified, the task runs every subproject's, and the Flutter plugins are subprojects here |
| `twin-parity` | ubuntu-latest | `diff -rq apps/mobile_android/lib apps/mobile_ios/lib` + `test/` |
| `schema-codegen-drift` | ubuntu-latest | re-run `gen_dart_models.dart` (regenerates `db_rows.dart` + `DbRows.kt`), fail if working tree dirty |
| `api-client-integration` | ubuntu-latest | `packages/api_client` integration suite against local Supabase |
| `edge-functions` | ubuntu-latest | Deno test for every function in `apps/backend/supabase/functions/` |
| `pgtap-rls` | ubuntu-latest | `supabase test db` for the pgtap RLS suite |
| `e2e-web` | ubuntu-latest | Playwright sharded 14-way over `apps/web/tests-e2e/` |
| `e2e-web-livehub` | ubuntu-latest | Playwright against the real Go live-hub WebSocket binary (unsharded) |
| `e2e-web-sso` | ubuntu-latest | Playwright over the OAuth / SSO login path against a local mock OIDC server (unsharded) |

Branch protection requires a single status check — the **`CI gate`** aggregator job, which `needs:` every job above (so adding a job auto-gates merges once it's listed); on a docs-only diff the `changes` filter job skips the heavy jobs and the aggregator still reports, so `CI gate` is always present and always real.

iOS builds + Edge Function deploys run from `.github/workflows/release-ios.yml` and `release-backend.yml` on tag, not on PR. See [releasing.md](../ops/releasing.md) for the release-time pipeline.

## Common tasks

### Run all tests

```bash
# All Flutter packages — Melos 7 needs `melos exec`, not `melos run` (CLAUDE.md gotcha)
pnpm test:flutter           # wraps `melos exec -- flutter test`

# Targeted Flutter subset (when you don't want every package):
melos exec --scope="run_recorder" --scope="mobile_android" -- flutter test

# Web
pnpm test:web:unit          # tsx --test on apps/web/src/lib/**/*.test.ts
pnpm test:web:e2e           # Playwright
pnpm test:web:e2e:ui        # Playwright in headed mode

# Go worker
pnpm test:worker            # wraps `cd apps/job_worker && go test ./...`
```

### Check for lint issues across all packages

```bash
pnpm check:flutter          # wraps `melos exec -- dart analyze`
pnpm check:web              # wraps `pnpm -C apps/web check`
```

### Add a dependency to a specific package

```bash
cd packages/gpx_parser
flutter pub add xml
```

### Update all package dependencies

```bash
melos exec -- flutter pub upgrade
cd apps/web && pnpm update
```

### Regenerate schema types after a migration

```bash
# Both generators in one go (requires `pnpm dev:db:up` to be running):
pnpm gen:all                # = pnpm gen:types && pnpm gen:dart

# Or individually:
pnpm gen:types              # TypeScript → apps/web/src/lib/database.types.ts
pnpm gen:dart               # Dart → packages/core_models/lib/src/generated/db_rows.dart

# Verify the TS file is in sync with the local DB (matches the CI check)
pnpm gen:types:check
```

### Regenerate app icons after editing the mark

The app icon is a single vector master at `assets/icon.svg`. Every platform's
raster icon (web favicon / touch / PWA, iOS + watchOS app-icon sets, Android +
Wear OS mipmaps, the Garmin launcher) is generated from it — never hand-edited.
After changing `assets/icon.svg`, regenerate them all in one command:

```bash
# Requires inkscape + ImageMagick 7 (the opt-in asset-pipeline tools).
./assets/gen-icons.sh
```

The script is deterministic and idempotent: it re-renders each target at its
committed pixel size (iOS/watchOS icons come out opaque truecolor, no alpha, as
the App Store requires). The web header + PWA use `apps/web/static/logo-mark.svg`,
a hand-authored vector derived from the same mark (edit it directly), and the
`wordmark.svg` / `wordmark-light.svg` lockups, which are GENERATED by
`./assets/gen-wordmark.sh`: it outlines "Threkir" in Noto Sans Bold with Inkscape
and sizes the canvas to the outlined name. Don't hand-edit them back to live
`<text>` — an `<img>` SVG renders live text in the viewer's own fallback font,
which clipped the name to "Threki" on CI's DejaVu Sans;
`brand_icon_color_guard.test.ts` fails on a `<text>` in any shipped brand SVG.

The Android status-bar notification small icon is a third hand-authored
derivative: `apps/mobile_android/android/app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_stat_threkir.xml`,
a white-on-transparent monochrome glyph (Android masks a small icon to its alpha
silhouette, so the full-colour launcher mipmap renders as a solid square — that
was the #483 bug). Its accent colour comes from `res/values/colors.xml`
(`brand_ember = #FFFE5932`, the master's ember gradient stop). If you change the
mark's glyph or the ember colour, update this drawable/colour to match.
`apps/web/src/lib/brand_icon_color_guard.test.ts` pins the canonical
`#FE5932 → #A01E77` pair across every machine-readable brand surface (master SVG,
manifest, `app.html` theme-color, the web SVG lockups, the Android colour + the
notification drawable) so a single-platform edit can't silently drift the icon
colour again.

### Deploy Edge Functions

```bash
# One per directory under apps/backend/supabase/functions/
# (clip-public-track, delete-account, events-checkout, events-connect-onboard,
#  export-data, parkrun-import, refresh-tokens, revenuecat-webhook,
#  strava-import, strava-webhook, stripe-events-webhook)
for fn in apps/backend/supabase/functions/*/; do
  name=$(basename "$fn")
  [ "$name" = "_shared" ] && continue
  supabase functions deploy "$name" --project-ref {project-ref}
done
```

Three of these (`refresh-tokens`, `strava-webhook`, `export-data`) have been
superseded by the Go worker but are kept deployed as the rollback path — see
[api_database.md](../backend/api_database.md) for the per-function status.

### Apply a database migration

Every schema change has to flow through both client type generators so the TypeScript and Dart row classes stay in sync. The workflow is:

```bash
# 1. Create migration file (must be cwd'd into apps/backend — the CLI looks for config.toml there)
cd apps/backend && supabase migration new add_metadata_to_runs

# 2. Edit the generated SQL file in apps/backend/supabase/migrations/
# 3. Apply locally (from repo root)
pnpm dev:db:reset

# 4. + 5. Regenerate both client row-type files
pnpm gen:all

# 6. Commit the migration SQL + both regenerated files together
git add apps/backend/supabase/migrations apps/web/src/lib/database.types.ts \
        packages/core_models/lib/src/generated/db_rows.dart

# 7. Push to production
cd apps/backend && supabase db push --project-ref {project-ref}
```

CI runs `npm run gen:types:check` in the `parity-types` job; if you forget to regenerate, the build fails with a diff against the committed `database.types.ts`. The Dart side is gated too: the `schema-codegen-drift` job re-runs `gen_dart_models.dart` (which regenerates `db_rows.dart` and the Kotlin `DbRows.kt`) and fails the PR if the committed files drift. On top of that, `dart analyze` will flag any stale column references you left behind in `api_client`.

See [schema_codegen.md](schema_codegen.md) for how the generators work, when they trip, and how to test drift detection.
