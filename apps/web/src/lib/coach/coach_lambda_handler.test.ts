// `apps/web/src/lib/coach/handler.ts` is the transport-agnostic core and is
// well covered. `apps/web/lambda/coach/src/index.ts` is the wrapper that
// actually runs in production, and it owns everything the core does not: which
// sub-path a request dispatches to, which byte cap that sub-path gets, the
// base64 body decode, the custom auth header, the hardcoded
// `bypassPaywallEnabled: false`, and the outer fail-closed envelope an audit
// finding installed. None of it had ever been executed — of the eight Lambdas
// under `apps/web/lambda/`, only `share-entity` was driven by a test at all
// (decisions § 896).
//
// The module reads a runtime-provided `awslambda` global at import time, so the
// stub below is installed before the dynamic import rather than at the top of
// the file. Every case here stops before any network call: the wrapper's own
// refusals, plus the core's `parseAuthHeader` 401, which fires before the first
// Supabase client is constructed.
