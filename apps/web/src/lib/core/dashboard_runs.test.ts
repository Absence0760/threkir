// The dashboard fetch was changed from an unbounded `fetchRuns()`
// (`select('*')`, paging the ENTIRE history 1000 rows at a time incl. the
// metadata jsonb bag) to a bounded `fetchRunsForDashboard()` — a ~2-year
// window, column-narrowed. Issue #332.
//
// The perf change itself can't be unit-tested (it's a Supabase query
// shape — pinned by the source guard in data.test.ts). What MUST be
// proven is the risk the window introduces: that no dashboard card
// computation silently goes blank or wrong when it only sees the last
// ~2 years instead of all runs ever. Every consumer here is recency-
// scoped (90-day load curve, this-week goal, recency-weighted race
// predictor, day streak), so the windowed set must produce the SAME
// answer the full history would — that's the safety contract.
//
// Runs with cwd = apps/web (`test:unit`). data.ts can't be imported here
// (it pulls the supabase singleton + `$env`), so the window contract is
// imported from the pure `./dashboard_runs` sibling that data.ts uses.
