/**
 * Signup-confirmation landing on the wrong route (issue #363).
 *
 * The confirmation link only lands on /auth/callback when the hosted
 * Supabase project's Site URL + Redirect-URLs allow-list say so — a
 * dashboard setting no code can enforce. When it is wrong the link lands
 * on the Site URL instead (`/?code=<pkce>`), where detectSessionInUrl
 * still exchanges the code and mints a LIVE session while the
 * confirm_age_and_terms() retry and the GDPR Art 8 consent gate never
 * run, leaving age_confirmed_at / terms_accepted_at unset.
 *
 * The app now fails closed: any stray code lands back on /auth/callback,
 * which owns the consent path. Pin it, and pin that the routes which own
 * their own `code` are not hijacked.
