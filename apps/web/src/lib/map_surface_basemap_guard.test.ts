// Guard-rail: a map surface's overlay paint resolves off the BASEMAP, and the
// OS colour preference is only ever allowed to choose the basemap itself.
//
// §526 measured what happens when those two are conflated: the map-style
// preference decouples basemap luminance from the OS in both directions
// (`outdoors` is light ground under a dark OS, `dark` and `satellite` are dark
// ground under a light one), and all six map surfaces branched on
// `prefers-color-scheme`. 35 of 49 cartographic literals failed the basemap
// they were actually drawn over, missing by roughly a factor of two either
// way. Five surfaces were routed through `basemapIsDark`; `basemap_contrast.ts`
// is the palette that resolver feeds.
//
// Nothing stopped a sixth. So the register below is the list of map surfaces,
// and it is checked in both directions: a new file that instantiates MapLibre
// must be added to it, and every entry must resolve its ground through the
// shared resolver rather than the OS. The load-bearing check is the third one
// — the OS-preference symbol may reach a style URL, a basemap classifier, or a
// slug table, and nothing else. That is the mechanical form of "the OS may
// pick the basemap; it may not pick the paint".
//
// Deliberately NOT checked: `prefers-color-scheme` in a surface's <style>
// block. A map component's CSS also styles its list rows and chrome, which
// ARE theme surfaces — § 526's violet `--kept-accent` on RouteHeatmap was
// exactly that, keyed on the theme on purpose. A guard that banned the media
// query outright would be wrong about half its matches. (That particular
// example is now app.css's `--color-route-pinned`, § 536 — the reasoning holds,
// but the local declaration it named is gone.)
//
// Invocation:
//   npx tsx --test src/lib/map_surface_basemap_guard.test.ts
