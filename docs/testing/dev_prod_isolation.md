# Dev / prod isolation

Local development must not be able to read or write production data, talk to live payment processors, or burn paid AI spend. This doc is the operating contract; the runtime guard in `apps/web/scripts/env_isolation.mjs` enforces it.

## The rule

When running locally — `pnpm dev:run:web`, `pnpm test:e2e`, or any other `pnpm dev:*` script — every external endpoint that the app talks to must point at a loopback address. Anything else aborts the process with a clear fix-it message.

Loopback / emulator addresses accepted by the guard:

| Address | Used by |
|---|---|
| `http://127.0.0.1:*` | Native dev on the workstation |
| `http://localhost:*` | Same |
| `http://10.0.2.2:*` | Android emulator alias for the host loopback |
| `http://host.docker.internal:*` | Docker-on-Mac / Docker-on-Windows |

## Env-file layout (every app)

One convention repo-wide so a fresh clone runs locally without a copy step ([decisions §137](../architecture/decisions.md)):

| File | Tracked? | Holds | Loaded by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.env.example` | committed | placeholder template (real values blank) | nothing — reference only |
| `.env.development` | committed | **non-secret** ready-to-run local defaults (loopback URLs + the public Supabase demo keys) | the app's loader (below) |
| `.env.local` | **gitignored** | your real keys / per-machine overrides — precedence is **toolchain-specific** (wins for Gradle/Go; **loses to `.env.development` on Vite/web**, see § 137) | the app's loader |

Per-toolchain loader (only Vite has a real "mode", so the mechanics differ):

- **web (Vite):** auto-loads `.env.development` for `vite dev`. Priority highest-first (Vite 8): shell env > `.env.development.local` > **`.env.development`** > `.env.local` > `.env` — the mode file outranks `.env.local`, so per-machine web overrides go in the shell or `.env.development.local`, not `.env.local`.
- **backend (Supabase functions):** `supabase functions serve --env-file .env.development` (or `.env.local`); nothing auto-loads.
- **mobile (flutter_dotenv):** loads the `.env.development` bundled asset; the per-machine override is **`--dart-define`**, not `.env.local`, because dotenv reads from the asset bundle. Release builds read neither (kDebugMode gate).
- **Wear (Gradle):** reads `.env.development` then overlays `.env.local`; release reads neither.
- **job_worker (Go):** a stdlib `loadEnvFiles(".env.local", ".env.development")` at startup; existing env wins. Prod ships only the binary (multi-stage image), so neither file is present and Fly secrets are the sole source.

The committed `.env.development` files carry only the public Supabase demo JWTs; the `gitleaks` allowlist and the `env-isolation` job in [ci.yml](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) scan them by path so a *real* key slipping in fails the build.

## What is guarded

The guard ships with two enforcement points and a shared check.

### 1. Vite dev server (web)

`apps/web/vite.config.ts` wires the `envIsolationGuard()` plugin. On every `vite dev` start the plugin reads `process.env` + `.env.local` and aborts the boot if anything looks non-local. This is the primary control:

- `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_URL` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `LIVE_HUB_URL` / `PUBLIC_LIVE_HUB_URL` / `PUBLIC_EXPORT_HUB_URL` / `PUBLIC_OSRM_URL` / `OSRM_URL` / `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — must be loopback when set. The PUBLIC_-prefixed pair (`LIVE_HUB_URL` / `EXPORT_HUB_URL`) is what the web client reads at build time; the un-prefixed `LIVE_HUB_URL` is the Dart twin's dotenv form. Both forms are guarded so a stray inherited-shell env doesn't slip past either path. `OSRM_URL` is server-only on web (the dev `/api/routes/osrm` proxy reads it — issue #198) and doubles as the Dart twin's dotenv form; `PUBLIC_OSRM_URL` is unread by code since the proxy landed but stays guarded so a stale prod value in a `.env.local` is flagged, not silently ignored.
- `GRAPHHOPPER_URL` / `GRAPH_CYCLE_URL` — the two route-generation engines the dev `/api/routes/generate` route reads from private env. Same risk shape as the hubs above with a price attached: one generate races `REQUEST_MULTIPLIERS` × seeds, up to 32 upstream fetches, so an inherited value naming the production GraphHopper or graph-cycle sidecar turns every local route build into a burst against a billed prod engine. Both were unguarded from the day the generator chain landed.
- `PUBLIC_TILE_STYLE_URL` / `PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_WEB_CHECKOUT_URL` / `PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_WEB_PORTAL_URL` are URL-shaped and deliberately **not** required to be loopback — they are declared in `NOT_ISOLATED_URL_VARS` with the reason. A test walks the web tree for URL-shaped env reads and fails when one is neither guarded nor declared, so the list can no longer silently miss the next endpoint the way it missed these five.
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` / `PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY` — refuses `sk_live_…` / `pk_live_…`; expects `sk_test_…` / `pk_test_…`.

### 2. Playwright globalSetup (e2e)

`apps/web/tests-e2e/fixtures/auth.ts` runs the same check before any test signs in. Defends against the inherited-shell-env case: a developer who has `SUPABASE_URL=https://prod.supabase.co` in their `~/.bashrc` (for an unrelated project) would otherwise have every Playwright `getAdminClient()` call hit prod with the seed-user fixtures.

### 3. Unit tests

`apps/web/scripts/env_isolation.test.mjs` has 22 `node:test` cases covering loopback / prod-URL / live-key / override / multi-finding paths plus the coverage walk over the tree's own URL-shaped env reads. Run via `node --test apps/web/scripts/env_isolation.test.mjs` (or your IDE's test runner). The `env-isolation` job in `ci.yml` runs it on every non-docs PR, and the `CI gate` waits for that job ([decisions § 862](../architecture/decisions.md)) — it used to live in a path-filtered workflow of its own, which no required check waited for.

## The override (escape hatch)

For the rare case a developer genuinely needs to point local at a non-local URL — e.g. running e2e against a per-PR Supabase branch — set:

```bash
ALLOW_PROD_URL_IN_DEV=true
```

The guard prints a one-line warning and continues. Two rules:

1. Never commit a setup that depends on this. Each `.env.example` must work with the guard ON.
2. Never set this in CI without an explicit, documented reason. The CI sweep below detects accidental commits.

## What is NOT guarded by the runtime gate

- The Supabase CLI itself. `supabase link --project-ref <ref>` legitimately points the CLI at prod for one-off ops (`supabase functions deploy …`). Linking is intentional; that's why it's not blocked.
- Direct `curl` or admin-script calls a developer types. We can't intercept those.
- Direct production logins via the Supabase Studio web UI.

What we CAN do: the `/audit/secrets` command (see `.claude/commands/audit/secrets.md`) finds prod keys committed to git history. Run it before any release.

## When the guard fires

Sample message:

```
========================================
[env-isolation guard] Vite dev server refuses to start.

Local dev must not be configured against production endpoints.
Found:

  - PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = https://abcdefghijk.supabase.co
      rule: remote-host-in-dev
      fix:  Set PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL to a loopback URL (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:24321) or unset it.

Power-user override (NOT for daily use):
  ALLOW_PROD_URL_IN_DEV=true

See docs/testing/dev_prod_isolation.md for the full policy.
========================================
```

Each finding tells you the env var, the broken value (key values are redacted as `<redacted live key>`), the rule, and the fix.

## Adding a new guarded env var

When you add an integration that takes a new env var:

1. If it's a URL → append the name to `KNOWN_ENV_VARS` in `apps/web/scripts/env_isolation.mjs`.
2. If it's a key with distinguishable test vs live patterns (Stripe-style) → append a `KEY_PATTERNS` entry.
3. Add a unit test in `apps/web/scripts/env_isolation.test.mjs`.

Keep the matcher conservative: a false positive aborts every dev session. Match only the literal patterns the upstream provider documents.
