# GitHub OIDC provider + per-env deploy roles.
#
# GitHub Actions assume these roles via OIDC token exchange — no long-
# lived AWS keys in `Settings → Secrets`. The trust policies are
# scoped per env:
#
#   prod    only assumable from a job in the gated `production` environment
#   preview only assumable from a job in the `preview` environment
#
# Permissions: each role can sync the env's S3 bucket, invalidate the
# env's CloudFront distribution, and update the env's Lambda. Nothing
# else.
#
# ── Trust-policy contract that has to stay in sync with the workflow ──
#
# The deploy jobs in release-web.yml declare GitHub ENVIRONMENTS
# (production for `web@*` tags — gated on the environment's
# required-reviewer rule — preview for the push-to-main leg), and a
# job that declares an environment gets `:sub` =
# `repo:<owner/repo>:environment:<name>` INSTEAD of the ref shape.
# So the trust policies pin the environment claim:
#
#   environment:production   → assumes deploy_prod
#   environment:preview      → assumes deploy_preview
#
# This is strictly tighter than the old refs/tags/web@* match: only a
# job that passed the production environment's approval gate can even
# request the prod role, whatever its trigger. A workflow that does
# NOT declare the environment (any PR, any fork, any other event)
# carries a ref- or pull_request-shaped sub and matches neither role.
# The web@1.0.3 release failed AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity when the
# environments landed while these still matched the ref shape — the
# two halves must move together.
#
# ── Immutable subject claims ──
#
# The subject is NOT `repo:<owner>/<repo>:…`. This repo issues IMMUTABLE
# SUBJECT CLAIMS, so GitHub substitutes numeric IDs for both names:
#
#   repo:Absence0760@21693150/threkir@1202414286:environment:production
#
# Those IDs survive a rename, which is the feature. `web@1.5.0` deployed fine
# on 2026-09-10 and every deploy after failed AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity with
# `Not authorized`, twelve retries deep, naming nothing.
#
# What turns immutable subjects on is NOT established. The 2026-09-14 rename
# was the obvious suspect and is wrong on its own: of twenty repos in this
# org, five carry immutable subjects and fifteen do not, and `feohledger` is
# among the five without ever having been renamed. So do not reason about
# which repos are affected — READ the prefix per repo, every time.
#
# A name-shaped StringEquals can never match an ID-shaped subject, and this is
# silent until something tries to deploy.
#
# `github_subject_prefix` therefore holds the literal prefix, read from
# `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/oidc/customization/sub`. Do not
# reconstruct it from `github_repo` — that is the bug this comment exists
# to stop someone reintroducing.

# ── CloudFrontInvalidate scoping caveat ──
#
# `cloudfront:CreateInvalidation` is granted on `Resource: "*"` in
# both deploy roles below because:
#   1. The CloudFront distribution doesn't exist when this stack is
#      applied (`envs/<env>` apply happens after `github-oidc`).
#      Threading the distribution ARN as a var creates a circular
#      dependency between the two stacks.
#   2. CloudFront has no resource-level permissions for invalidation
#      regardless — IAM ARNs aren't matched against distribution IDs
#      for this specific action; AWS only enforces account-level
#      isolation here.
# Net effect: a leaked prod token can invalidate the preview
# distribution and vice versa. Blast radius is "stale-cache flush",
# not data exposure. If we ever multi-tenant a single AWS account
# under different trust boundaries, split this into per-distribution
# managed policies and accept the apply-ordering tax.
