# Gym workout programming

A scoped **depth-tier gym-programming engine** — reusable routines, structured execution (supersets / set-types / rest), planned-vs-actual adherence, and progression schemes — layered as a parallel planning structure on top of the existing flat `gym_workouts` / `gym_sets` log. It mirrors the run side's `plan_workouts` → `WorkoutRunner` precedent (jsonb-`structure` + scalar targets, expand-once, the planned-vs-actual metadata trio with an 80%-of-target cutoff) and diverges only where the gym domain forces it (sets × reps × load end axis, supersets, rest timers, reps/load adherence instead of pace tolerance).

> **Status:** **P1 shipped on web + mobile** (2026-06-11, migration `20270101_001`): `gym_routines` / `gym_routine_exercises` / `gym_routine_sets` + `gym_workouts.metadata`, the `gym_routine` parity helper (`routineFromWorkout` + `prefillFromRoutine`, web + Dart twin), the `/gym/routines` library / `[id]` detail / `new` builder, "Save as routine" + "Repeat last" on `/gym/[id]`, DSAR export of all three tables (Deno twin **and** the production Go worker `exportPersonalDataSpecs`), Playwright + pgtap. **Mobile twin shipped:** `LocalRoutineStore` (offline-first, exercises+sets inline), the routine library + detail screens + the routine builder sheet, the Routines entry on the gym AppBar, "Save as routine" + "Repeat last" on the gym detail screen, ARB keys across all seven catalogues, and widget + store tests — byte-identical on the iOS twin. P1 is prefill-only on both surfaces (no execution loop). **P2/P3 pure-logic + runner shipped (2026-06-11):** the structured-expansion + adherence + progression parity pairs and the execution runner are merged — `gym_routine.expandRoutineSteps` (web + Dart twin), the `gym_adherence` pair (`computeRoutineAdherence`, the per-axis 80%-of-target cutoff reducer), the `gym_progression` pair (`nextPrescription`), the `GymWorkoutRunner` (`packages/run_recorder/lib/src/gym_workout_runner.dart`) consuming the expansion, and the `gym_workouts.metadata` execution trio (`routine_id` / `gym_step_results` / `gym_adherence`, registered in [metadata.md](../backend/metadata.md) + `MetadataKeys`). **Web execution UI shipped (2026-06-12):** the guided-session runner — `/gym/session/[routineId]` (loads the routine → `expandRoutineSteps` → `GymSessionRunner`), the per-set `GymExecutionBand` (target + reps/load pip + prefilled reps/weight/rpe + Done/Skip/Rewind/Abandon), the `RestTimer` between sets, the discard `ConfirmDialog`, and on finish writes the `routine_id` / `gym_step_results` / `gym_adherence` trio via `createGymWorkout(metadata)` + redirects to `/gym/[id]`, which mounts `GymWorkoutReview` (planned-vs-actual table + adherence % + verdict) when the trio is present. The routine `[id]` Start button now routes to the runner (the P1 prefill-only modal was removed). **Mobile caught up 2026-09-17 ([decisions § 1645](../architecture/decisions.md)):** `routine_detail_screen.dart` had kept BOTH — a "Start session" FAB over a "Start routine" prefill FAB, stacked and unexplained — so the drift was mobile's, not web's. It now carries the single guided-runner Start; `prefillFromRoutine` stays, since "Save as routine" on the gym detail screen still uses it. **Mobile P2 authoring + P4 progression UI shipped (2026-06-12):** the routine builder sheet now authors the full structure — a per-exercise modality dropdown that swaps the target field (weight×reps / bodyweight / time / distance), a "Superset with the next exercise" switch that brackets adjacent exercises into a group (via the `routine_editor_build` parity pair `assignSupersetGroups`, mirroring web), per-set set-type + rest, and an Advanced expander with the progression scheme + scheme-dependent params; `createGymRoutine` / `LocalRoutineStore` persist the new `superset_group` / `superset_order` / `modality` / `progression` / `progression_params` / `set_type` / `rest_s` / `target_duration_s` / `target_distance_m` columns (honouring the `gym_routine_exercises_superset_chk` both-null-or-both-set invariant). The routine detail screen renders the set-type, modality-aware target, rest-per-set, a superset badge chip + a progression chip per exercise. The `GymSessionScreen` runner now passes the persisted superset group/order + set_type + rest + duration through to `expandRoutineSteps` (authored supersets interleave + rest ticks). **P4 progression UI:** at session start each progression-tracked exercise's last logged session (read from `LocalGymStore` via the `progression_prefill` parity pair `lastSessionSets`) seeds `nextPrescription` and prefills the expanded step targets (still editable in the band); on the gym workout review, a neutral next-target chip ("+5 kg" / a rep-climb "8→9" + a short reason) renders per scheme-tracked exercise from this session's logged sets, using the primary-container colour distinct from the red/amber adherence pills. ARB keys across all seven catalogues; the `routine_editor_build` + `progression_prefill` unit tests + builder/detail/store widget tests; byte-identical iOS twin. **Not yet merged:** none for the mobile gym-programming surface — P1–P4 author/execute/progress now ship on both web and mobile. The P4 progression *engine* validation gate (Coach-authored reads) remains as specced (see [Phasing](#phasing--rollout) and [The validation gate](#the-validation-gate-stated-honestly)). **Logged-set set_type shipped (2026-06-20, migration `20270228_001`, decisions §189):** the flat-log side now carries the same set-role axis the routine sets always had — `gym_sets.set_type` (NOT NULL, default `working`, same six-value CHECK as `gym_routine_sets.set_type`, the `gym_sets.set_type ↔ GymSetType` pair in `check_constraint_unions.mjs`). Composers expose a per-set type picker (web `GymEditor` select / mobile `gym_compose_sheet` dropdown); detail screens chip the non-working roles; the guided runner threads each step's `set_type` onto the logged set. RPE was already a `gym_sets` column. This is the "RPE / set-type metadata" Gym-mid roadmap bullet. **Routine history shipped 2026-08-15 (§617), mirrored to mobile 2026-08-18 (§651) and moved onto a server-side aggregate 2026-08-18 (§658, migration `20270528_001`):** `/gym/routines/[id]` and `routine_detail_screen.dart` read the execution trio back per routine — performed-session count, days since it was last done, completed-of-graded ratio, and the five most recent sessions as links — via the `gym_routine_history` RPC + the `routine_history` parity pair. It classifies a "Save as is" row as *ungraded* (out of the rate denominator, not a miss) and excludes in-flight drafts outright, in SQL as well as in the client shaping. See [Routine history](#routine-history--on-gymroutinesid).

## Product contract

A user who logs gym sessions can:

- **Save a routine** — a named, ordered list of planned exercises with target sets × reps × load (or RPE), optional supersets, set-types, and per-set rest.
- **Repeat last** — one-tap re-instantiate a prior session (no saved routine required), with the engine suggesting the next target (linear bump or hold).
- **Start a routine** — a set-by-set execution loop with a top execution band (`Bench Press · Set 2/4 · 5 reps @ 80 kg` + reps/load-hit pip + rest countdown), supersets run round-robin.
- **Review adherence** — after a session, planned-vs-actual per set with a `completed` / `partial` / `abandoned` pill.
- **Follow a progression scheme** — linear, double-progression, 5×5, %-of-1RM cycles (5/3/1), or RPE auto-regulation prescribe the next session's targets from logged history.

Everything **self-hides** until a routine exists: a runner who never programs sees today's gym log unchanged. The engine **only suggests** — it never auto-mutates targets from logged data without a confirm step.

Non-goals for v1: multi-week program grouping (a `gym_programs` layer over routines is deferred), public-routine browse/discovery UI, a structured exercise catalog (binding stays free-text via `normaliseExerciseName`), and any wrist follow-along (see [Mobile & watch § watch scope](#watch-scope--defer-the-wrist-follow-along)).

## The validation gate (stated honestly)

The roadmap lists full programming as the gym **"heavy" depth tier** and marks "exercise database, workout templates, programmes, RPE-driven progression" **Not in scope** for the shipped lightweight log ([roadmap.md](../product/roadmap.md), the `**Not in scope:**` bullet; the "Gym — heavy (full programming)" heading just below it). The sequencing **gate** is the roadmap's *measure gym engagement before committing to nutrition* validation-gate sentence in the Phase-4 sequencing block. (These line numbers drift — search by the quoted text, don't trust a line number.)

**This design does not jump that gate — it relocates it.** Rather than running a separate measurement-only phase, we sequence the engine so its cheapest slice (**P1**, reusable routines + "repeat last", near-zero new schema) *is itself the gate probe*. P1 ships a self-contained durable win; if its repeat-rate signal clears an owner-set threshold (suggest ≥20% of gym sessions over 4–6 weeks), P2–P4 are justified. If it doesn't, we freeze at P1 and leave P2–P4 specced-but-unbuilt.

- **The bet:** repeat-logging of the same exercises (already reconstructable today via `initExercises` + `normaliseExerciseName`) is evidence users want a routine.
- **The explicit tradeoff:** faster-to-signal, at the cost of building the routine schema before the gate formally clears. The durable alternative the owner is choosing against is "clear the gate first, then build any schema."
- **The owner must sign this off.** For SOC 2 / GovRAMP-scoped changes (Coach-authored progression reads logged sets), loop in the CISO / Security Analyst before that path ships.

```

The **plan** shape (routine tables) and the **log** shape (`gym_workouts` / `gym_sets`, unchanged) bind by `normaliseExerciseName` + order, **never by FK** between activity rows. A routine is reusable and is *not* a dated activity, so it does not feed the `activities` view.

## Data model

Planned structure is **relational, not jsonb** — the deliberate divergence from the run precedent. A run interval workout is a shallow single-axis tree edited as one blob, so `plan_workouts.structure jsonb` fits. A gym routine is the opposite: a list of exercises, each with a list of typed sets, queried per-exercise ("what's my planned 5/3/1 top set for squat"), bound to logged sets by normalised name, progressed row-by-row. That wants real rows + indexes. We keep **one** jsonb escape hatch — `progression_params` — for the per-scheme tuning bag, exactly mirroring the "evolve without a migration" rationale.

**Naming & conventions.** `gym_routines` (plural snake_case; "routine" is the lifting-domain term and the gym route namespace is clean of `program`/`template`/`plan`). Owner column = **`author_id`** (routines are authored content, convention F17). Offline-first → **`last_modified_at`** client-stamped, newer-wins, **no** server `updated_at` trigger. CHECK idiom matches the existing gym tables: `length(...)` (not `char_length`), and the `X is null or length(X) <= N` form for nullable text.

> **One coherent storage decision, used everywhere below:** the plan → session link and the planned-vs-actual trail live in **`gym_workouts.metadata`** (jsonb), mirroring the run side's `runs.metadata` trio — **not** a typed `routine_id` FK column on `gym_workouts`. Rationale: the step-result shape can evolve without a migration, a deleted routine leaves a harmless dangling id (immutable history), and it keeps byte-for-byte symmetry with the run review trail. **`gym_workouts` has no `metadata` column today** — the migration adds it (see [§ Prerequisite](#prerequisite-add-gym_workoutsmetadata)).

### The three planning tables

#### `gym_routines` — a user-owned named workout plan

```sql
create table public.gym_routines (
  id                uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  author_id         uuid not null references auth.users (id) on delete cascade,
  title             text not null check (length(title) between 1 and 120),
  notes             text check (notes is null or length(notes) <= 1000),

  -- periodisation model for the routine as a whole (narrow union ↔ CHECK pair)
  periodisation     text not null default 'none'
                      check (periodisation in ('none','linear','block','conjugate')),

  -- denormalised count for the list screen; client-stamped on save, NOT a trigger cache
  exercise_count    int not null default 0 check (exercise_count >= 0),

  external_id       text,                                    -- per-author import idempotency
  last_modified_at  timestamptz not null default now(),      -- client-stamped, newer-wins; NO trigger
  created_at        timestamptz not null default now()
);

create unique index gym_routines_author_external_id_key
  on public.gym_routines (author_id, external_id) where external_id is not null;
create index gym_routines_author_modified_idx
  on public.gym_routines (author_id, last_modified_at desc);
```

- **No global `is_public` column in v1.** Public-routine sharing is a real feature (publish a 5/3/1 template), but shipping public-read RLS *before* the browse UI exists means any authenticated user can already enumerate public routines' `notes` + planned sets through the REST API (a `public-rows` leak). We ship **author-only RLS** now and add `is_public` + its public-read branch in the *same* migration that ships the browse UI. (Recorded as a deferred follow-up, not dropped forever.) **The leak-safe subset — club-scoped templates — shipped 2026-06-12** (migration `20270109_001`, decisions §145): a `gym_routines.club_id` makes a routine club-owned and readable only by club members (`private.is_club_member`), with a `publish_gym_routine_as_template` (author + club-admin gated) / `clone_gym_routine_template` (author-or-member) RPC pair mirroring `clone_session_template`. Web surfaces: a publish-row on `/gym/routines/[id]` + an Adopt list on the club Templates tab; **plus a one-step club create from the Templates-tab "Add template" hub** (`/plans/new?club=<id>` → Gym routine → on save `onGymCreated` calls the same `publish_gym_routine_as_template` RPC and returns to the tab, leaving a personal source routine — decisions §146 amendment 2026-06-14, pinned by `tests-e2e/gym/club-routine-template-create.spec.ts`). This needs no global `is_public`, so the public-browse leak concern is untouched. **Mobile mirror shipped 2026-06-12** (byte-identical twin): `api_client` `fetchClubGymRoutineTemplates` / `publishGymRoutineAsTemplate` / `cloneGymRoutineTemplate`; an author + admin-club-gated publish-row + a "Club template" badge on `routine_detail_screen.dart` (`StoredRoutine.clubId`, an optional `SocialService` threaded GymScreen → RoutineLibraryScreen → RoutineDetailScreen for the admin-club fetch); a gym-routine-templates section with per-row Adopt on the `club_detail_screen.dart` Templates tab. **The global public-library slice — the deferral above — shipped 2026-06-20** (migration `20270226_001`, decisions §182), honouring the "add `is_public` + its public-read branch in the *same* migration that ships the browse UI" condition exactly: `gym_routines.is_public_template` (+ a `gym_routines_public_not_club` CHECK keeping public and club visibility strictly separable) + additive public-read RLS on the routine + exercises + sets (gated on `auth.role() = 'authenticated'`, mirroring the public PLAN library `20270126_001`), a public-template branch added to `clone_gym_routine_template` (any signed-in caller clones a public template into a personal, club-less, non-public copy — same rate limit + deep-copy), and a `set_gym_routine_public(routine_id, public)` author-gated publish/unpublish toggle (refuses a club-owned routine so the two branches never overlap). A gym routine carries no private fitness data — its target loads ARE the published prescription — so nothing is stripped on publish or clone (unlike the plan library, which strips the publisher's VDOT). **Web ✓:** `/gym/routines/library` (search + author handle), `[id]` preview + Adopt (`fetchPublicGymRoutineLibrary` / `cloneGymRoutineTemplate` / `setGymRoutinePublic` in `core/data.ts`), an owner publish/unpublish toggle + badge on `/gym/routines/[id]`, a Library link on `/gym/routines`. **Mobile ✓** (byte-identical twin): `api_client` `fetchPublicGymRoutineLibrary` / `setGymRoutinePublic`; `RoutinePublicLibraryScreen` + `RoutinePublicPreviewScreen` reached from a Library action on `routine_library_screen.dart`; the publish toggle + badge on `routine_detail_screen.dart` (`StoredRoutine.isPublicTemplate` + `LocalRoutineStore.setPublicLocal`). pgtap `public_gym_routine_library_test.sql`; Playwright `public-routine-library.spec.ts`; Flutter widget tests in `routine_detail_screen_test.dart` + `routine_public_library_screen_test.dart`. **Redaction hardening 2026-07-03** (migration `20270319_001`, audit/public-rows): the base-table public-read branch exposed `external_id` (per-user import crosswalk) + `last_modified_at` (the offline-sync clock, which keeps ticking on the author's private edits after publish), so non-author reads of the routine PARENT now go through the redacted `public_gym_routines` view (template-safe columns only, authenticated-only grant) and the exercises/sets child policies answer via the `private.is_public_gym_routine` SECURITY DEFINER oracle; the library orders by `created_at` (the browse index re-pointed to match), and both clients' `fetchPublicGymRoutineLibrary` / `fetchGymRoutineDetail` read the view (the detail fetch falls back to it when the owner-only base read misses).
- **No `(user_id, started_at desc)` spine index** — routines don't feed `activities`. `(author_id, last_modified_at desc)` serves the list screen + sync drain.

#### `gym_routine_exercises` — planned exercises within a routine, with grouping

```sql
create table public.gym_routine_exercises (
  id                  uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  routine_id          uuid not null references public.gym_routines (id) on delete cascade,

  -- stable identity: free-text name for display, normalised key for binding to logged gym_sets
  exercise_name       text not null check (length(exercise_name) between 1 and 120),
  exercise_key        text not null check (length(exercise_key) between 1 and 120),

  -- ordering + grouping for supersets/circuits
  position            int not null check (position >= 0),    -- order of the GROUP within the routine
  superset_group      int,                                   -- null = standalone; shared int = same superset
  superset_order      int check (superset_order >= 0),       -- round-robin order within the group

  -- exercise modality (narrow union ↔ CHECK pair)
  modality            text not null default 'weight_reps'
                        check (modality in ('weight_reps','time','distance','bodyweight_reps')),

  -- per-exercise progression scheme (narrow union ↔ CHECK pair)
  progression         text not null default 'none'
                        check (progression in
                          ('none','linear','double_progression','five_by_five','percent_cycle','rpe_autoreg')),
  progression_params  jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb,    -- scheme tuning bag (the ONE jsonb escape hatch)

  notes               text check (notes is null or length(notes) <= 500),

  constraint gym_routine_exercises_superset_chk
    check ((superset_group is null) = (superset_order is null))
);

create index gym_routine_exercises_routine_idx
  on public.gym_routine_exercises (routine_id, position, superset_order);
create index gym_routine_exercises_key_idx
  on public.gym_routine_exercises (exercise_key);            -- "what's planned for squat" lookups
```

- **Grouping model.** `position` orders the *groups*; a non-null `superset_group` ties exercises into one superset/circuit; `superset_order` gives the round-robin sequence inside the group. A standalone exercise has `superset_group = null, superset_order = null` and is its own group at `position`. This is the relational analogue of the run runner's grouped expansion — `expandRoutineSteps` round-robins across a `superset_group` rather than walking a linear list.
- **`exercise_key`** is `normaliseExerciseName(exercise_name)` stamped **at write time** — by the server since `20270711000001`, by the client before it. It is the stable identity that binds a planned exercise to logged `gym_sets` (which carry only free-text `exercise_name`). Storing it as a column lets us index it and keeps binding deterministic. **Freeze policy:** the key is frozen at write time; if the normaliser ever changes, a backfill migration re-stamps it. Documented in `derived_state.md` as a non-cache invariant.
  **A client older than the normaliser gets a plain save failure, deliberately** (decisions § 1252). That was the state until migration `20270711000001`, which stamps both this column and `exercises.name_key` server-side the way `gym_sets.exercise_key` already was — replacing a client-supplied value rather than rejecting it, so the refusal below is no longer reachable and the durable fix named at the end of this paragraph has landed. It is recorded here because the reasoning is what a future client-stamped column inherits. While both columns were client-stamped and held by a validated CHECK naming the SQL function, a build predating [§ 1175](../architecture/decisions.md) wrote a key the server refused with a `23514` from `gym_routine_exercises_exercise_key_canonical`. There is no "update the app" message and there should not be: the current client raises the same code for reasons that have nothing to do with its version, and telling the two apart would need the stale client to re-derive the server's fold, which is the one thing it cannot do. The reachable population is empty in practice — of the 465 code points a pre-§ 1175 phone folds differently, **zero** lie in Latin-1 Supplement, Latin Extended-A, Latin Extended-B, Cyrillic, Latin Extended Additional or Greek Extended, so reaching the refusal means naming a lift in Cherokee, Georgian Mtavruli, Deseret, Adlam, Garay, Medefaidrin, Vithkuqi or Sidetic — and it closes the moment that build updates. The durable fix — stamping both columns server-side — shipped in `20270711000001`.

#### `gym_routine_sets` — planned target values per set

```sql
create table public.gym_routine_sets (
  id                  uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  routine_exercise_id uuid not null
                        references public.gym_routine_exercises (id) on delete cascade,

  set_index           int not null check (set_index >= 0),   -- per-exercise, 0-based (NOT the flat workout index)

  -- set type (narrow union ↔ CHECK pair)
  set_type            text not null default 'working'
                        check (set_type in ('warmup','working','dropset','amrap','failure','backoff')),

  -- target reps: a single value (min only) OR an inclusive range (double-progression needs the range)
  target_reps_min     int check (target_reps_min >= 0),
  target_reps_max     int check (target_reps_max >= 0),

  -- target load: absolute kg OR a %1RM (exactly one, or neither for bodyweight/RPE-only)
  target_weight_kg    numeric(7,2) check (target_weight_kg is null or target_weight_kg >= 0),
  target_percent_1rm  numeric(5,2) check (target_percent_1rm is null
                          or (target_percent_1rm > 0 and target_percent_1rm <= 200)),

  target_rpe          numeric(3,1) check (target_rpe is null or (target_rpe >= 0 and target_rpe <= 10)),

  -- rest after this set, seconds (the explicit inter-set timer step; mirrors run 'walk'/'recovery')
  rest_s              int check (rest_s is null or (rest_s >= 0 and rest_s <= 3600)),

  -- tempo: eccentric-pause-concentric-pause string e.g. "30X0"
  tempo               text check (tempo is null or tempo ~ '^[0-9X]{3,4}$'),

  -- time / distance targets for non-rep modalities
  target_duration_s   int check (target_duration_s is null or target_duration_s >= 0),
  target_distance_m   numeric(10,2) check (target_distance_m is null or target_distance_m >= 0),

  constraint gym_routine_sets_load_chk
    check (not (target_weight_kg is not null and target_percent_1rm is not null)),
  constraint gym_routine_sets_rep_range_chk
    check (target_reps_max is null or target_reps_min is null or target_reps_max >= target_reps_min)
);

create index gym_routine_sets_exercise_idx
  on public.gym_routine_sets (routine_exercise_id, set_index);
```

- **Reps as a range** (`target_reps_min` / `_max`): a single target leaves `_max` null; double-progression needs the range (e.g. 8–12). `amrap` / `failure` leave both null (open-ended). This is the canonical rep shape — the web builder and the progression engine both read it; there is no single `target_reps` column.
- **Load as kg OR %1RM, never both** (`gym_routine_sets_load_chk`). kg is canonical (reuse `format/weight.ts`); %1RM resolves to kg at instantiation via `estimatedOneRepMax` over the bound exercise's logged history (reuse `gym_prs`). Neither set → bodyweight or pure-RPE prescription.
- **Tolerance is computed, not stored.** Adherence (below) reuses the run side's 80%-of-target cutoff per set; there is no per-set `tolerance` column, matching the run side where tolerance is a runner default.

### Adherence — the single definition used everywhere

> One coherent rule across the engine, review panel, and progression input — **per-axis, never volume-product.** For each **non-warmup** planned set, it is a **hit** when `actual_reps >= 0.8 * target_reps_min` **AND** (when load is prescribed) `actual_weight_kg >= 0.8 * target_weight_kg`. Load is skipped for bodyweight / time / distance modalities.

- A **time** set (`target_duration_s`) with no rep target is graded on its own axis: `hit` when `actual_duration_s >= 0.8 * target_duration_s`, else `partial`. A **distance** set (`target_distance_m`) mirrors it: `hit` when `actual_distance_m >= 0.8 * target_distance_m`, else `partial` (a distance/duration target left unlogged is `partial`, not `hit`). When a set carries a weight target *and* a duration/distance target, the duration/distance is the primary axis while the weight is unrecorded (an unlogged weight is graded on that axis, not auto-missed); a weight that IS logged and falls short still misses. This closed issue #328 — a distance-modality set used to fall through to `else` and grade `hit` unconditionally, and its target never reached `GymExecutionBand`.
- Any **skipped** step OR any step under the per-axis cutoff → `partial`.
- Abandon flag → `abandoned`.
- Otherwise → `completed`.
- `warmup` sets are **excluded** from the adherence denominator (skipping a warmup must not mark the session `partial`). `amrap` / `failure` sets count as **completed if any reps, duration, or distance were logged**.

Per-axis (not the reps×weight product) is the chosen resolution: it matches how lifters think (you got the reps or you didn't) and the run precedent's per-step semantics, and it is the load-bearing `evaluateHit` input the progression engine consumes — so the same rule governs the review pill and the next-target computation.

### Narrow-union ↔ CHECK pairs to register

Each real column below needs a TS union in `apps/web/src/lib/types.ts` (via `Omit & {…}`), a CHECK in the migration, and a `PAIRS` entry in `apps/web/scripts/check_constraint_unions.mjs` (CI `parity-types` fails the PR otherwise). The Dart side treats all four as raw `String` (no Dart enum); invalid writes are rejected at the DB — same as `RunSource` / `ActivityType`.

| Column | Domain |
|---|---|
| `gym_routines.periodisation` | `none \| linear \| block \| conjugate` |
| `gym_routine_exercises.modality` | `weight_reps \| time \| distance \| bodyweight_reps` |
| `gym_routine_exercises.progression` | `none \| linear \| double_progression \| five_by_five \| percent_cycle \| rpe_autoreg` |
| `gym_routine_sets.set_type` | `warmup \| working \| dropset \| amrap \| failure \| backoff` |

`gym_adherence` (`completed \| partial \| abandoned`) is a **metadata value, not a column**, so it gets a TS union + client-side validation + a `metadata.md` entry, but **no CHECK** — exactly how the run side's `workout_adherence` is handled.

### RLS (owner-scoped, mirror `gym_workouts`)

```sql
alter table public.gym_routines          enable row level security;
alter table public.gym_routine_exercises enable row level security;
alter table public.gym_routine_sets      enable row level security;
```

- **`gym_routines`**: `select` / `insert` / `update` / `delete` all gated on `author_id = auth.uid()` in v1. A club-member SELECT branch was added for club-owned templates (`20270109_001`). The public-library read (`20270226_001`) moved OFF the base table in `20270319_001`: non-author reads of public templates go through the redacted `public_gym_routines` view, and the exercises/sets public-read policies answer via `private.is_public_gym_routine` (the parent row is RLS-hidden from non-authors).
- **`gym_routine_exercises`** + **`gym_routine_sets`**: no own owner column — gate via `EXISTS` against the parent routine (`routine_id` / `routine_exercise_id` → `gym_routines.author_id = auth.uid()`), exactly how `gym_sets` is "visible via parent."

### On-delete behaviour

- `gym_routines.author_id → auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` (account-deletion erases routines — Art. 17).
- `gym_routine_exercises.routine_id → gym_routines(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- `gym_routine_sets.routine_exercise_id → gym_routine_exercises(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- **Deleting a routine does NOT touch logged `gym_workouts` / `gym_sets`** — the link is a metadata string, not an FK, so prior executed sessions stay intact (the `metadata.routine_id` becomes a harmless dangling id, exactly like a deleted `plan_workout_id` on a run). History is immutable by design.

### Indexes (summary)

| Index | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `gym_routines (author_id, last_modified_at desc)` | list screen + sync drain |
| `gym_routines (author_id, external_id) unique where external_id not null` | import idempotency (mirrors `gym_workouts.external_id`) |
| `gym_routine_exercises (routine_id, position, superset_order)` | ordered expansion incl. superset round-robin |
| `gym_routine_exercises (exercise_key)` | "what's planned for squat" cross-routine lookups |
| `gym_routine_sets (routine_exercise_id, set_index)` | ordered per-exercise set read |

No `(user_id, started_at desc)` spine index — routines don't feed `activities`.

### Prerequisite: add `gym_workouts.metadata`

`gym_workouts` was created (`20261204_001`) without a jsonb bag — unlike `runs`. Before any planned-vs-actual storage works, the migration must add it:

```sql
alter table public.gym_workouts
  add column metadata jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb;
```

- **Migration-lock safety:** `add column … default '{}'` is **metadata-only** on PG11+ (no table rewrite, no blocking scan) — safe on the populated prod table. The three new routine tables are empty at creation, so none take a blocking lock. No FK is added to `gym_workouts` (the link is a metadata string), so there is no `SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE` validation scan to worry about. Run `/audit:migration-locks` to confirm before landing.
- **`activities` view check (required task):** adding a column to `gym_workouts` is only safe if the `activities` UNION view's lift branch enumerates explicit columns. **Read the view definition and confirm the lift branch does not `select *`** — if it did, the new `metadata` column would change the branch's shape and break column-count alignment with the run branch. (It selects `(id, user_id, kind, started_at, summary, is_public)` — explicit columns per branch, so `metadata` is excluded — but verify, don't assume.)

### Both codegen regenerations (mandatory)

1. **`npm run gen:types`** → regenerates `apps/web/src/lib/database.types.ts` (committed). Then add the four narrow unions to `types.ts` and the four `PAIRS` entries to `check_constraint_unions.mjs`.
2. **`dart run scripts/gen_dart_models.dart`** → regenerates `packages/core_models/lib/src/generated/db_rows.dart` (committed). **Prerequisite, not an aside:** verify the generator emits a field for a `jsonb not null default '{}'` column (`progression_params`, and the new `gym_workouts.metadata`) *before* committing to the schema. `numeric(7,2)` / `numeric(3,1)` are already proven by `gym_sets`; jsonb on a brand-new column is the open one. If the generator drops it, **grow the parser** in `gen_dart_models.dart` — never hand-edit `db_rows.dart`. The generator ignores CHECK / index / RLS / `~` regex / table-level constraints by design.

## Progression engine

The "intelligence" — **pure math over the last session's sets + config, no side effects.** It does not read the DB, does not write a routine, does not auto-mutate anything. The (impure) instantiation layer calls it, gets a `ProgressionSuggestion`, and prefills an editable draft the user can still change before logging. This keeps the engine a Tier-1 "inform" computation; the Tier-2 "command" (writing a routine row) is a deliberate user-confirmed step elsewhere.

### Module decomposition — three small parity pairs

The engine is **three** pure TS↔Dart parity pairs, not one monolith (the cleaner factoring; each is independently testable). All three go on the tracked-pair list in root `CLAUDE.md` and are checked by `shared-library-syncer` after edits:

| Pair (web ↔ mobile) | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `gym/gym_routine.ts` ↔ `gym_routine.dart` | `routineFromWorkout`, `prefillFromRoutine`, `expandRoutineSteps` (grouped/round-robin plan → flat step list) |
| `gym/gym_adherence.ts` ↔ `gym_adherence.dart` | the per-axis 80%-cutoff reducer + skip/abandon logic → `'completed' \| 'partial' \| 'abandoned'` |
| `gym/gym_progression.ts` ↔ `gym_progression.dart` | `nextPrescription` — the next-target prescriber per scheme |

Mobile lives flat under `apps/mobile_android/lib/` (where the existing gym helpers `gym_prs.dart` / `exercise_history.dart` / `lift_load.dart` already sit — there is no `lib/gym/` subdir on mobile today; web nests under `gym/`, mobile is flat) and is mirrored **byte-identical** into `apps/mobile_ios/`. Each pair has identical algorithm, edge cases, outputs, and **test count** on both sides. They reuse `estimatedOneRepMax` + `normaliseExerciseName` (both reachable from `gym_prs`, which since decisions § 1515 re-exports the key derivation from `packages/core_models`) and consume the `ExerciseSession[]` series from `exercise_history.ts` (`previousExerciseSession`) — so the prescriber and the "vs last time" hint can never drift. (The mobile `exercise_history.dart` mirror has already landed and is a tracked parity pair, so "next target" can reuse `previousExerciseSession` without new mirror work.)

### Core types (`gym_progression`) — API of record

The shipped signature is a **single flat input → single suggestion**. `nextPrescription` looks only at the *last session's* logged sets (`lastSets`), the exercise's target rep range, and a loose `params` bag; it does not take a chronological `history` array or a rich config object. This is what the tests pin and what both the web runner and the mobile P4 prefill call.

```ts
export type ProgressionScheme =
  'none' | 'linear' | 'double_progression' | 'five_by_five' | 'percent_cycle' | 'rpe_autoreg';

export interface ProgressionSetLike {
  reps: number | null;
  weight_kg: number | null;
  rpe: number | null;
}

export interface ProgressionInput {
  scheme: ProgressionScheme;
  lastSets: ProgressionSetLike[];        // the most-recent logged session's working sets
  targetRepsMin: number | null;
  targetRepsMax: number | null;
  params: Record<string, unknown> | null; // scheme-specific knobs, all optional (see below)
}

export type ProgressionReason =
  | 'increase_weight'
  | 'increase_reps'
  | 'hold'
  | 'establish_baseline'
  | 'deload'
  | 'none';

export interface ProgressionSuggestion {
  suggestedWeightKg: number | null;      // null ⇒ bodyweight / no load to add
  suggestedRepsMin: number | null;
  suggestedRepsMax: number | null;
  reason: ProgressionReason;
}

export function nextPrescription(input: ProgressionInput): ProgressionSuggestion;
```

`estimatedOneRepMax` + `normaliseExerciseName` are re-exported from `gym_prs` for callers, but `nextPrescription` itself takes no `ExerciseSession[]` — the caller reduces history to `lastSets` before calling (mobile does this via the `progression_prefill` pair's `lastSessionSets`).

### `params` knobs (all optional, read per scheme)

| key | default | used by |
|---|---|---|
| `incrementKg` | `2.5` | linear / double_progression / five_by_five / rpe_autoreg load bump |
| `targetSets` | `5` | five_by_five success threshold |
| `targetReps` | `5` | five_by_five (fallback when no rep range) |
| `maxConsecutiveMisses` | `3` | five_by_five deload trigger |
| `consecutiveMisses` | `0` | five_by_five deload counter — **derived, never authored**: `progressionParamsWithStreak` (progression_prefill) counts the exercise's most recent logged sessions that failed the bar and injects it. Nothing else supplies it, so before that derivation the deload branch was unreachable |
| `deloadFactor` | `0.9` | five_by_five deload multiplier |
| `percent` | — | percent_cycle (fraction of 1RM, e.g. `0.85`) |
| `oneRmKg` | — | percent_cycle (training max / 1RM in kg) |
| `targetRpe` | — | rpe_autoreg |

**What counts as a judged set (`workingSets`, both platforms).** Every scheme's "did they hit it?" test runs over the completed sets — rep-less rows and the three deliberately-submaximal set types (`warmup`, `backoff`, `dropset`) dropped — **narrowed to those done at the session's top completed weight**. The narrowing catches a ramp-up whether or not it carries a label: unlabelled, a 2-rep ramp-up failed the rep test and held the load forever, while three light sets of five padded a `five_by_five` into an unearned promotion. It is also the truer reading of "five sets of five" — a lighter back-off set is not one of the five. A session with no positive weight anywhere (bodyweight) keeps every completed set. See [decisions.md § 602](../architecture/decisions.md).

The label still does work the narrowing cannot, and in two places. A warmup logged **at** the working weight is not lighter, so only `set_type` separates it. And a **bodyweight** session has no positive weight to narrow on, so every completed set survives — which is why `backoff` and `dropset` are excluded by label too: an assisted set of four typed `dropset`, logged after three clean sets of eight, failed the rep target and stalled the exercise permanently ([decisions.md § 680](../architecture/decisions.md)). `amrap` and `failure` stay judged: both are performed at the working weight, so their rep count is real evidence about it. Both history RPCs (`gym_exercise_set_history`, `gym_exercise_set_history_batch`) return the column since migration `20270525_001`, and all three `GymSetWithDate` producers in `core/data.ts` map it — until then the web prescriber never received it while mobile, reading its local store, did. See [decisions.md § 605](../architecture/decisions.md).

A weight bump is guarded by `safeAdd` (never drives the load ≤ 0) and every load is `round1`-ed to 0.1 kg. There is no plate-rounding, no display-unit round-trip, and no `trainingMaxKg`/`weekIndex`/`percentWave` wave table — those belong to the deferred design below.

### Schemes (as shipped)

| Scheme | Rule (one line) | Worked example |
|---|---|---|
| **none** | Suggests nothing — all fields null, `reason: 'none'`. | any input → `{null, null, null, 'none'}`. |
| **linear** | All completed sets ≥ the top rep target → `increase_weight` (+`incrementKg`); any short set (or no completed set / no rep target) → `hold` at the top weight. Bodyweight (no top weight) success raises the rep target instead → `increase_reps`. | Squat 3×5@100 all hit → **102.5, increase_weight**; one set @4 → **hold 100**. |
| **double_progression** | Below `targetRepsMax` → `increase_reps` at the same weight; all sets at `targetRepsMax` → `increase_weight` (+`incrementKg`) and reps reset to `targetRepsMin`. Bodyweight at the top raises the ceiling (`targetRepsMax + 1`) instead of dropping load. | DB press 8–12: 3×8@60 → **increase_reps, 60, max 12**; 3×12@60 → **62.5, min=max=8**. |
| **five_by_five** | Success = `≥ targetSets` working sets all ≥ `targetReps` → `increase_weight`. `consecutiveMisses ≥ maxConsecutiveMisses` → `deload` (`× deloadFactor`). Otherwise `hold`. Bodyweight success bumps the rep target. | 5×5@80 hit → **82.5**; 4 hit + 1 short → **hold 80**; 3rd miss → **80×0.9 = 72, deload**. |
| **percent_cycle** | Prescribes `round1(percent × oneRmKg)`. No prior top weight (first / bodyweight session) → `establish_baseline`; prescribed > last top weight → `increase_weight`; else `hold`. Missing/invalid `percent`/`oneRmKg` → `hold` at the last weight. | 0.85 × 150 = **127.5**; over a prior 120 → `increase_weight`; from a bodyweight log → `establish_baseline`. |
| **rpe_autoreg** | Compares the max achieved `rpe` across completed sets to `params.targetRpe`. Below target → `increase_weight` (+`incrementKg`), or a rep-target bump for bodyweight; at/above target (or missing RPE data) → `hold`. | RPE 7/7.5 vs target 8 @100 → **102.5, increase_weight**; RPE 9/9.5 → **hold 100**. |

### Edge cases (identical both sides)

- **`none` scheme:** always the all-null `none` suggestion, regardless of `lastSets`.
- **Empty `lastSets` (or no completed reps):** every scheme except `none` returns `hold` (there is nothing to progress from); `percent_cycle` still prescribes if `percent`/`oneRmKg` are present.
- **Bodyweight (no positive `weight_kg` in any set):** the suggestion never invents a load — `suggestedWeightKg` stays null and progress is expressed as a **higher rep target** (`increase_reps`), never a re-prescription of the same count and never a reduction below a maxed range.
- **Negative / zero `incrementKg`:** `safeAdd` clamps so the suggested weight is never ≤ 0.
- **Non-finite / string inputs:** `numericOrNull` coerces (accepts numeric strings, rejects everything else); a null/NaN rep is simply not counted as completed.
- **Determinism:** no `Date.now()`, no RNG — a pure function of `input`, so the TS and Dart twins produce identical numbers.

### Deferred / future design — richer table-driven engine (NOT shipped)

An earlier spec envisioned a more elaborate engine and is preserved here so the intent isn't lost. **None of the following is implemented** — do not treat it as the current contract; growing `nextPrescription` toward it is a separate future feature (the P4 progression-engine validation gate below). The deferred shape:

- A three-argument signature `nextPrescription(history, lastActuals, config)` taking the full chronological `ExerciseSession[]` (not just `lastSets`) plus a `LastSessionActuals | null` and a structured `ProgressionConfig`.
- A rich `ProgressionConfig` with a `LoadingConfig` (`unit`, `incrementDisplay`, `smallestPlateDisplay`), explicit `targetSets`/`targetReps`/`repRangeMin`, `deloadAfterMisses`/`deloadFactor`, and — for a true 5/3/1 `percent_cycle` — `trainingMaxKg` (explicit TM, else 0.9 × best e1RM), `weekIndex`, a `percentWave` table (default Wendler 65/75/85 → 70/80/90 → 75/85/95 → 40/50/60 deload), and `tmIncrementKg`; plus `targetRpe`/`rpeRepTarget` for RPE autoregulation.
- A structured `PrescribedSession` output (`sets: PrescribedSet[]` with per-set `isAmrap`/`targetRpe`, echoed `trainingMaxKg`) and a 7-variant `ProgressionRationale` union — `first_session`, `progress`, `hold`, `rep_climb`, `deload`, plus the two the shipped `ProgressionReason` has no equivalent for: **`wave_step`** (5/3/1 wave advance) and **`rpe_adjust`** (RPE-driven ±increment nudge).
- Shared primitives `evaluateHit`, `consecutiveMisses`, and a display-unit `roundToPlate` plate-quantiser (so a 5/3/1 percentage and a linear +2.5 land on the same plate grid, with a barbell-context clamp skipped for micro-load accessories).

The shipped engine collapses this to the flat single-session shape above: a 6-variant `ProgressionReason` (no `wave_step`/`rpe_adjust`), `round1`-to-0.1-kg instead of plate rounding, a caller-supplied `consecutiveMisses` count instead of history reduction, and a plain `percent × oneRmKg` prescription instead of a TM wave table.

## Execution: planned-vs-actual + adherence

The `GymWorkoutRunner` is the direct mirror of `WorkoutRunner`: a state machine that sits **on top of** the gym logging session (not inside it), consumes `expandRoutineSteps`, drives a set-by-set band, and persists prescribed-vs-actual.

**An unmeasured axis logs null, never the target.** The mobile session screen
originally had reps / load / RPE inputs only and reported a timed set's actual
duration as `step.targetDurationS` — so every timed set persisted a
`gym_sets.duration_s` exactly equal to plan, and the duration axis of
`computeRoutineAdherence` graded green regardless of what happened. Timed
steps now carry their own duration input (empty by default, matching web's
`GymExecutionBand`), so an unrecorded hold logs null and is graded as such.
Any future modality must add its input alongside the axis, not fall back to
the prescription.

**Distance closed the same way (2026-07-24).** A distance target was worse than
the duration one: `GymRunnerStep` carried no `targetDistanceM` at all, so the
session screen dropped it building the steps, `_metadataTrio` emitted no
`target_distance_m`, and `computeRoutineAdherence` — with no distance target to
see — fell off the end of its axis chain and graded every distance-modality set
a flat `hit` whatever the athlete did. `GymRunnerStep.targetDistanceM` /
`isDistanceBased` + `GymRunnerSetResult.actualDistanceM` now carry the axis, the
session screen renders a distance input whenever the step has a target
(**empty by default**, like duration — so an unrecorded carry logs null and
grades `partial`, never the target), the band's target label shows the distance,
and the metadata step-results carry `target_distance_m` / `actual_distance_m`.
Distance has **no `gym_sets` column**, so a distance-only set writes no flat set
row and is graded purely through the metadata trio — mirroring web's
`GymSessionRunner.buildSets`; the finish counter counts it regardless.
Web moved to match in the same pass: its `GymExecutionBand` had been prefilling
the distance input from the target (as it does reps and load), so a web athlete
who tapped Complete without touching the field logged the prescription as the
actual — the same dishonesty one layer up. The rule is now stated positively and
pinned by `gym_execution_band_seeding.test.ts`: **reps / load / RPE seed from
the prescription** (a target the athlete confirms by completing the set),
**distance and duration seed empty** (measurements — the app must not invent
one). Any future axis has to pick a side of that line deliberately.

- **Lives in `packages/run_recorder/`** (where `WorkoutRunner` lives, per `workout_runner.dart`) so iOS/watch can reuse it. The package name is a known smell — the gym runner has zero GPS/`RunRecorder` dependency — accepted for reuse symmetry rather than spinning a sibling package; noted so a future session doesn't trip on it.
- **State machine** emits a `GymExecEvent` stream (`SetTransition`, `RestStarted` / `RestProgress` / `RestComplete`, `SetLogged`, `Complete`, `Abandoned`); idempotent `skipSet` / `rewindSet` (one deep) / `abandon`. Step transitions route through a `ValueNotifier` to avoid hot-path full-tree rebuilds, mirroring the run band.
- **Supersets** run round-robin (Set 1 of A → Set 1 of B → rest → Set 2 of A …), not a linear list.
- **Rest** is an explicit duration-based step kind, mirroring the run side's `walk` recovery; a local `Timer` drives the countdown, no server round-trip.
- **Crash-safety dual save:** a `reviewMetadata()` analogue runs on **both** the in-progress save tick and final stop, so a mid-session crash preserves the trail.
- **Leave guard + resume (mobile, issue #666 U5):** the session Scaffold sits under a `PopScope(canPop: false)`, so a system back / AppBar back mid-session routes through the same three-way dialog as the band's Abandon control — *keep going* / *leave (draft kept)* / *discard*. The 10 s durable save stamps the draft row with `gym_session_draft` metadata (an ordered per-step outcome list, registered in [metadata.md](../backend/metadata.md)); the gym screen surfaces any draft whose routine still exists as a resume card (Resume / Save as is / Discard, mirroring the run screen's Resume / Finish / Discard). Resume rebuilds the runner by **replaying** the outcome list through the public runner API — the current step is derived, never stored — and re-anchors elapsed to `now − saved duration_s`, so time the app was gone isn't counted (matching `resumeSession`'s elapsed semantics on the run side). A draft whose routine was deleted degrades to a plain workout row (no card).

### The metadata trio (on `gym_workouts.metadata`)

Mirrors the run trio. Registered in [metadata.md](../backend/metadata.md):

| `gym_workouts.metadata` key | Shape | Mirrors |
|---|---|---|
| `routine_id` | uuid string — the `gym_routines.id` this session instantiated | `plan_workout_id` |
| `gym_step_results` | array, one per expanded planned set (below) | `workout_step_results` |
| `gym_adherence` | `'completed' \| 'partial' \| 'abandoned'` | `workout_adherence` |

Per-step result JSON (`GymStepResult.toJson()` in the runner package, mirroring `WorkoutStepResult`):

```jsonc
{
  "step_index": 4,
  "routine_exercise_id": "…",
  "exercise_key": "squat",
  "set_type": "working",
  "superset_group": 1, "superset_round": 2,
  "target_reps_min": 5, "target_reps_max": 5,
  "target_weight_kg": 100.0,
  "target_rpe": 8,
  "actual_reps": 5, "actual_weight_kg": 100.0, "actual_rpe": 8.5,
  "actual_gym_set_id": "…",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

- **Binding plan → log.** On finish, the existing `buildSets` flattens to the flat positional `set_index` list and `replaceGymSets` writes `gym_sets` **unchanged** — the planning layer is fully parallel. Each step result carries `actual_gym_set_id`; binding also works by `exercise_key` + order when ids are unavailable (offline).
- **Adherence** uses the single per-axis 80% rule from [Data model § Adherence](#adherence--the-single-definition-used-everywhere) — computed locally by `gym_adherence.dart` from logged-vs-planned sets, no server call.
- **Two-signal completion** reused: a session counts as "from routine" when `routine_id` is present in metadata (the execution signal) — the same two-signal shape as the run side's `manually_completed` / `completed_run_id`, no new column.

## Web UI

SvelteKit, the canonical feature surface. Everything **self-hides** until a routine exists.

### Routine library — inside `/gym`

- A **Routines** section on the existing `/gym` page, **above** the workout list. The whole section self-hides when the user has zero routines — no empty "create your first" placeholder (that would violate self-hide).
- **Entry to create:** when routines exist → a `New routine` button in the section header. When none exist → routines are surfaced *only* via the `GymEditor` "Save as routine" affordance (§ low-friction entry) and via Coach.
- **Rows:** title, exercise count, superset glyph, last-used date, progression-model chip. Actions: **Start** (→ session), **Edit**, **Duplicate**, **Delete** (via global `ConfirmDialog`). As shipped, the list lives at `/gym/routines/+page.svelte` rather than in dedicated `RoutineCard` / `RoutineLibrary` components.
- **Routes:** the `/gym/routines` list (`/gym/routines/+page.svelte`), `/gym/routines/[id]` (detail/preview, mirrors `/plans/[id]`), and `/gym/routines/new` (thin wrapper around the builder, mirroring `/plans/new` ↔ `PlanEditor`). The only routine component that shipped is `RoutineEditor.svelte`.

### Routine builder — sibling of `GymEditor`

- **New `RoutineEditor.svelte`**, not an overload of `GymEditor` — the log's contract is *log actuals now*; the builder's is *prescribe targets, add supersets/rest/progression*. **Reuse** `GymEditor`'s in-memory `EditExercise{name, sets[]}` block model and the `<input list=datalist>` exercise picker (fed by `gym_exercise_names`) by extracting the block-list sub-UI into a shared **`ExerciseBlockList.svelte`** both editors mount (no copy-paste).
- Modal-hosted (`.modal-backdrop` / `.modal` / `oncreated` / `oncancel`); the `/gym/routines/new` route is the thin page wrapper.
- **Per exercise block:** target sets, per-set target reps (range), weight *or* `%1RM`, RPE (entry honours `weight_unit` via `format/weight.ts`), inter-set `rest_s`, a **superset toggle** that brackets adjacent blocks into a group, and drag-to-reorder.
- **Progression attach:** a per-exercise selector driving `gym_progression`'s prescriber.

### Follow / execute mode — `/gym/session/[routineId]`

A focused single-page surface (40–48rem cap), **not** a modal — execution is a sustained task like the run runner. On entry the prescriber prefills per-set targets. The **web execution band** (`GymExecutionBand.svelte`, the web-side analogue of `workout_execution_band.dart`):

1. `Bench Press · Set 2/4 · 5 reps @ 80 kg` + a **reps/load-hit pip** (green ≥ target, amber under, grey pending) — *no pace pip; the gym divergence.*
2. progress (sets done / total, superset round indicator).
3. collapsible controls: **rest countdown** (`RestTimer.svelte`, auto-starts on check-off), skip-set, mark-done.

Each prescribed set is a checkable row pre-filled with the target; the user edits reps/weight/RPE to actual and checks it off. **Crash-safety:** debounced in-progress write + a final write on finish. On finish → real `gym_workouts` + `gym_sets` log via `buildSets` / `replaceGymSets`, plus the metadata trio. Components: `GymSessionRunner.svelte`, `GymExecutionBand.svelte`, `RestTimer.svelte`.

**Time-modality sets (e.g. a plank) capture the ACTUAL hold, not the target.** When a step carries `targetDurationS`, the band shows a "Held (s)" field plus a Start/Stop stopwatch (`gym_stopwatch.ts`, a wall-clock-anchored pure helper — elapsed is recomputed from `now − anchor` each tick, not accumulated per tick, so a backgrounded/throttled tab reports the true elapsed on resume). The captured seconds — or a manually-entered value — flow into `EnteredSet.durationS`; **an untracked hold logs `null`, never the prescribed target.** This is the fix for the bug where `currentEntered()` hardcoded `durationS: step.targetDurationS`, so a plank cut short at 20s of 60s recorded a full 60s "hit". Only `Skip` records nothing. **Adherence history for time-modality sets logged before this fix was never real** (every timed set scored the target as its actual) — noted in release notes.

### Planned-vs-actual review — on `/gym/[id]`

Mirrors the run workout-review section. When the saved workout carries `routine_id`, `/gym/[id]` shows an **Adherence** panel (`GymWorkoutReview.svelte`, mounted conditionally; self-hides for ad-hoc workouts). It shows the adherence pill + a per-set hit/miss list using **glyph + label**, not colour alone (`✓ 5×80 / target 5×80`, `△ 4×80 / target 5×80`, `✗ skipped`). The hit rule is the single per-axis 80% cutoff — *not* a reps×weight volume product.

### Routine history — on `/gym/routines/[id]`

The read-back of the execution trio, per routine. Every guided session stamps `gym_workouts.metadata.routine_id` (and its verdict), but until 2026-08-15 nothing read it back per routine: a lifter could not see when they last ran a routine or whether they were finishing it, and the P1 repeat-rate signal the [validation gate](#the-validation-gate-stated-honestly) turns on had no surface at all.

`GymRoutineHistory.svelte` (owner-only, mounted on `/gym/routines/[id]` above the exercise list) shows the performed-session count, "Done N days ago", the completed-of-graded ratio, and the five most recent sessions as links back to `/gym/[id]` with their verdict pill. The counts come from the `gym_routine_history` RPC (migration `20270528_001`, decisions § 658) via `fetchGymRoutineHistory` in `core/data.ts`; the pure `gym/routine_history.ts#routineHistoryFromAggregate` shapes the bounded page of recent sessions the same call returns. **The count is complete, the list is a page** — a count is an aggregate, and the read used to window at 500 rows and reduce them in the browser, so a lifter running one routine weekly for a decade was shown a capped figure with nothing marking it as capped.

Three row classes have to be told apart. The SQL applies the same rules to the tallies AND to the page, in one snapshot, so the listed rows can never disagree with the count above them:

- **Graded** — carries a recognised `gym_adherence` verdict. Counted, and in the completed-rate denominator.
- **Ungraded** — carries `routine_id` with no verdict. This is a "Save as is" row: `stripSessionDraft` drops the draft marker and keeps the link while claiming no adherence, precisely because the session never ran to completion. It counts as a session performed but is neither a completion nor a failure, so it stays **out of the denominator** rather than reading as a miss.
- **In-flight draft** — still carries `gym_session_draft`. Not a session performed; excluded outright, so a page refresh mid-session cannot inflate a routine's usage.

The panel **self-hides at zero sessions** (the same self-hide contract as the routines section) but does **not** self-hide on a failed read — a load failure shows an inline retry, because "couldn't load" and "you have never run this" are different claims. It owns its own fetch so that failure cannot blank the prescription the page exists to show (§ Layered resilience).

Shipped on mobile 2026-08-18 (decisions § 651): `routine_detail_screen.dart` carries the same author-gated panel, `routine_history.dart` is the registered Dart twin (16 mirror tests each), and `ApiClient.fetchGymRoutineHistory` reads the same RPC — the phone reads the SERVER, not `LocalGymStore`, which holds only the most recent page of workouts.

### Low-friction entry — the adoption wedge

This is the most important adoption lever and what the validation gate measures:

- **`Repeat workout`** on `/gym/[id]` and each `/gym` row → opens `/gym/session/…` seeded from that prior workout's sets *as an ad-hoc routine* (no saved routine required); the prescriber suggests the next target. Delivers progression value before the user ever builds a routine.
- **`Save as routine`** on `/gym/[id]` → promotes the grouped in-memory blocks into a real `gym_routines` row. This is the **only create entry shown before any routine exists**, keeping the library self-hidden until earned.

### i18n (six locales)

Every new string lands in `en.ts` + `de/fr/es/ja/pt-BR` (`satisfies Messages` + `messages_parity.test.ts` enforce parity) before the call site uses `m('key')`, and mirrors to all mobile ARBs for the twin. Key groups: `gym.routine.*`, `gym.session.*`, `gym.review.*`. The band line is **interpolated** (`m('gym.session.bandSet', {set, total, reps, weight})`) — never string-concat; `weight` is pre-formatted via `format/weight.ts` so the unit follows the pref.

## Mobile & watch

Flutter (byte-identical twin) mirrors the web surfaces — strictly **downstream of web** (don't start the Flutter mirror until the web screens + the three parity pairs are merged and tested). Purely additive and self-hiding. **P1 shipped** (`local_routine_store.dart`, `screens/routine_library_screen.dart`, `screens/routine_detail_screen.dart`, `widgets/routine_builder_sheet.dart`, the Routines entry on `gym_screen.dart` + Save-as-routine/Repeat-last on `gym_detail_screen.dart`); execute mode (the runner + band rows in the table below) stays P2-deferred.

### Flutter screens & widgets

| New / extended | Mirrors web | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `screens/gym_screen.dart` (extend) | `/gym` list | Add a Routines section that **self-hides** with zero routines. Primary action stays "Log workout"; "Start routine" appears only once a routine exists. |
| `screens/routine_library_screen.dart` (new) | `/gym/routines` | Authored routines; pull-to-refresh drains the routine sync; tap → detail. |
| `screens/routine_detail_screen.dart` (new) | `/gym/routines/[id]` | Planned targets, supersets shown grouped/indented. Primary **Start**; secondary edit/duplicate/delete (delete behind `ConfirmDialog`). |
| `widgets/routine_builder_sheet.dart` (new) | `RoutineEditor` | Reuse the `gym_compose_sheet.dart` block model; add target fields (sets, rep range, weight or %1RM, RPE), drag-reorder, superset toggle; `gym_exercise_names` autocomplete; `normaliseExerciseName` key binds plan → log. |
| `screens/routine_execute_screen.dart` (new) | `/gym/session/[routineId]` | The "dwell-in capture page" — owns the foreground for the session; set checklist + rest sheet. |
| `widgets/gym_execution_band.dart` (new) | `GymExecutionBand` | Mirrors `workout_execution_band.dart` structure: line 1 label + reps/load-hit pip; line 2 rest countdown; line 3 collapsible skip/rewind/abandon. Routed through a `ValueNotifier`. No pace pip. |
| `widgets/gym_summary_card.dart` / `gym_detail_screen.dart` (extend) | `GymWorkoutReview` | Prescribed-vs-actual adherence + a "next target" suggestion; self-hides for ad-hoc workouts. |

Weight display/entry stays kg-canonical via the Dart weight formatter (byte-for-byte mirror of `format/weight.ts`); %1RM resolves to kg at instantiation via `estimatedOneRepMax`.

### Offline-first store

- **New `LocalRoutineStore`** (sibling of `LocalGymStore` / `LocalGearStore`), extending `OfflineSyncStore<StoredRoutine>`: one JSON file per routine under `<appDocs>/routines/`, with `gym_routine_exercises` + their planned sets carried **inline** (a routine is never partially useful). `StoredRoutine implements SyncEntry`: client-minted v4 UUID = server id, client-stamped `last_modified_at`, `syncState` (`synced` / `pendingCreate` / `pendingUpdate` / `pendingDelete`), tombstones. Methods: `createLocal` / `updateLocal` / `deleteLocal` / `byId` / `entryFromJson` / `summaryOf` / `asSynced` / `asPendingCreate`, plus the two server-ingest paths: `replaceFromServer` (a COMPLETE snapshot — it prunes every routine it wasn't handed, so the library refresh passes its `fetchLimit` and a full page preserves routines older than the oldest returned `last_modified_at`) and `upsertFromServer` (ONE routine fetched by id — the adopt flows, which must never prune).
- **An instantiated session is a `StoredGymWorkout`, not a new type.** Starting a routine reads it from `LocalRoutineStore`, expands via `expandRoutineSteps`, and prefills a `pendingCreate` `StoredGymWorkout` in the existing `LocalGymStore` — planned targets + the metadata trio ride in workout `metadata`. The logged-history pipeline (`activities` view, PR triggers, `volume_kg` cache) is unchanged.

### Execute mode offline

Fully offline by construction — no GPS/recorder stream. Instantiation reads local files; every check-off / edit / skip / rest tick mutates local state + the local JSON via the dual-save tick; on stop the session is a `pendingCreate` workout the normal `syncWithServer` drain pushes when connectivity returns. Adherence + "next target" computed locally by the parity pairs.

### Twin invariant & test obligations

- **Byte-identical twin:** every `lib/` + `test/` file added to `mobile_android` is copied byte-for-byte to `mobile_ios` (decisions §39); platform branches dispatch via `Platform.isIOS` inside the shared file, never two divergent files. Run `/audit:twin-parity` before declaring done.
- **Parity pairs:** after the web side lands, the three Dart pairs must match algorithm, edge cases, outputs, and **test count**; invoke `shared-library-syncer` after editing either side.
- **Tests:** `packages/run_recorder/test/gym_workout_runner_test.dart` (superset round-robin expansion, rest-step countdown, check-off auto-advance, skip/rewind-one/abandon, per-axis adherence, dual-save crash trail — mirror the `workout_runner_test.dart` shape); `gym_progression_test.dart` / `gym_adherence_test.dart` / `gym_routine_test.dart` (equal counts to their TS twins); `local_routine_store_test.dart` (sync states, drain order, `replaceFromServer` preserve-pending + newer-wins + `fetchLimit` window, `upsertFromServer` single-row adopt, inline round-trip — store I/O needs `tester.runAsync`); widget tests (builder superset grouping + %1RM→kg, execute band rest countdown + hit pip with dialog-scoped finders, detail "Start"). Mind the mobile-test gotchas: `pumpAndSettle` hangs on running animations; banner timers leave pending work. Mobile/watch have **no e2e** by design.

### Watch scope — defer the wrist follow-along

**Defer; ship mobile + web only this round.** The watch clients are a *wrist-only complement, not a pocket-app mirror*. A gym session is a stationary, two-hands-near-the-phone activity where the phone is glanceable on the floor by the rack — the opposite of running (phone pocketed, wrist is the only surface), which is *why* the run watch follow-along earns its place. Reps/load number entry on a 1.4" screen is exactly the fiddly interaction the watch scope rule pushes to the phone. A new Compose-for-Wear + SwiftUI screen, a new sync path (watches don't carry `LocalRoutineStore`), and a phone↔watch handoff are disproportionate cost. **Trigger to reopen:** a minimal wrist **rest-timer + set-advance haptic** *only if* mobile data shows users executing routines away from their phone. Record this one-liner in **both** `apps/watch_wear/CLAUDE.md` and `apps/watch_ios/CLAUDE.md` scope sections so a future session doesn't re-litigate it.

## Persistence

| What | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Routines (plan) | `gym_routines` + `gym_routine_exercises` + `gym_routine_sets` | relational; offline-mirrored in `LocalRoutineStore` (inline children) |
| Plan → session link | `gym_workouts.metadata.routine_id` | uuid string, not an FK |
| Planned-vs-actual trail | `gym_workouts.metadata.gym_step_results` | array of `GymStepResult` |
| Adherence verdict | `gym_workouts.metadata.gym_adherence` | `completed \| partial \| abandoned` |
| Logged sets (actual) | `gym_workouts` + `gym_sets` | **unchanged** — the existing flat log |
| `exercise_count` | `gym_routines.exercise_count` | **client-stamped on save, NOT a trigger cache.** Documented in `derived_state.md` as client-stamped + non-authoritative so a future session doesn't assume it's a derived cache. If we ever need server-authoritative counts, the full `derived_state.md` contract applies (full-recompute trigger, manual rebuild fn, pgtap that mutates source and asserts cache == recompute, recompute-from-scratch — never increment). |

No per-day/per-event growth → **no retention purge / pg_cron** for the planning tables.

### DSAR export + erasure (SOC 2 / GovRAMP — not optional)

- **Erasure (Art. 17):** handled by `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `auth.users` through all three routine tables; the metadata trail dies with the `gym_workouts` row. Verify with `/audit:account-deletion-completeness`.
- **Export (Art. 20 / CCPA):** the `export-data` Edge Function **must be extended** to include `gym_routines` + `gym_routine_exercises` + `gym_routine_sets` (and the new `gym_workouts.metadata` payload), with its completeness pgtap updated, or the export ships incomplete on day one. This is an explicit task in P1, not a follow-up. Verify with `/audit:data-export-completeness`.

## Failure modes

- **Routine deleted after a session ran it:** the session's `metadata.routine_id` becomes a harmless dangling id — history is intact (no FK, no cascade to logs).
- **Process killed mid-session:** the in-progress `StoredGymWorkout` is recovered from `LocalGymStore`; the dual-save tick means the metadata trail (`gym_step_results`, `gym_adherence`) is already on it. The in-progress set reads `skipped`; adherence reads `partial`.
- **Offline the whole session:** fully supported — instantiation reads local files, the runner is a local state machine, the rest timer is a local `Timer`; the `pendingCreate` workout syncs when connectivity returns.
- **Free-text name drift** ("Bench" vs "Barbell Bench Press"): the plan→log binding via `normaliseExerciseName` breaks and corrupts progression input. Inherited fragility until a stable exercise identity lands (see Open questions).
- **Fat-finger logged set (800 kg):** the prescriber would read it as a giant e1RM jump. The engine **only suggests**; the instantiation layer prefills an *editable* draft and never auto-logs. A "confirm next target" step is mandatory; auto-apply is never allowed.
- **Empty routine:** `expandRoutineSteps` yields zero steps → instant `Complete`, band doesn't mount, no null-deref.

## Testing

| Surface | Where | What |
|---|---|---|
| Parity pairs (×3) | `gym_progression`, `gym_adherence`, `gym_routine` — TS (`npx tsx --test`) + Dart (`flutter test`), **equal counts** | scheme outcomes (hit/partial/deload/rep-climb/wave/rpe nudge), per-axis 80% cutoff, expansion + superset round-robin, plate rounding incl. bodyweight + micro-load, first-session seeding, non-finite guards, determinism fixture |
| Runner | `packages/run_recorder/test/gym_workout_runner_test.dart` | expansion counts, auto-advance on check-off, rest countdown, skip/rewind/abandon idempotency, dual-save crash trail |
| Store | `local_routine_store_test.dart` | sync states, drain order, `replaceFromServer` preserve-pending + newer-wins + the `fetchLimit` count-window guard, `upsertFromServer` single-row adopt (leaves the rest of the library on disk), inline children round-trip (`tester.runAsync`) |
| Web widget / flow | Playwright `apps/web/tests-e2e/gym/` | `routine_builder.spec.ts`, `routine_session.spec.ts` (incl. one under-target + one skip → assert log created), `routine_review.spec.ts` (assert `partial` + per-set hit/miss AND ad-hoc workout shows **no** panel), `repeat_workout.spec.ts`, `routine-history.spec.ts` (graded / ungraded / in-flight-draft classification + the never-run self-hide), self-hide regression in `gym.spec.ts` |
| Backend | pgtap (`apps/backend/supabase/tests/`) | RLS author-only on all three tables + cascade-from-`auth.users`; `export-data` completeness includes the three tables; adherence-from-metadata math if any moves server-side |

Mobile widget tests cover the builder, execute band, and detail-Start instantiation. Mobile/watch have no e2e equivalent by design (web Playwright + backend pgtap cover the e2e path).

## File list

**Migration** — `apps/backend/supabase/migrations/20270101_001_gym_programming.sql` (next free slot; latest is `20261230_001` — re-confirm the next slot at land time, the migrations directory moves): `alter table gym_workouts add column metadata jsonb`, the three routine tables + indexes + RLS + four CHECKs.

**Generated (committed):** `apps/web/src/lib/database.types.ts`, `packages/core_models/lib/src/generated/db_rows.dart`.

**Web:** `src/lib/types.ts` (+4 unions), `scripts/check_constraint_unions.mjs` (+4 PAIRS), `src/lib/gym/gym_routine.ts`, `src/lib/gym/gym_adherence.ts`, `src/lib/gym/gym_progression.ts`, `src/lib/gym/routine_history.ts` (parity pair), `src/lib/core/schema.ts` (metadata routing), `RoutineEditor.svelte`, `ExerciseBlockList.svelte` (extracted), `GymSessionRunner.svelte`, `GymExecutionBand.svelte`, `RestTimer.svelte`, `GymWorkoutReview.svelte`, `GymRoutineHistory.svelte`, routes `/gym/routines/[id]`, `/gym/routines/new`, `/gym/session/[routineId]`, `/gym/[id]` (+ panel), i18n in every web locale.

**Mobile (`mobile_android` → byte-identical `mobile_ios`):** `lib/gym_routine.dart`, `lib/gym_adherence.dart`, `lib/gym_progression.dart`, `lib/local_routine_store.dart` (stores live flat in `lib/`, e.g. `local_gym_store.dart` — there is no `lib/stores/`), `screens/routine_library_screen.dart`, `screens/routine_detail_screen.dart`, `screens/routine_execute_screen.dart`, `widgets/routine_builder_sheet.dart`, `widgets/gym_execution_band.dart`, extend `gym_screen.dart` / `gym_detail_screen.dart` / `gym_summary_card.dart`, ARBs.

**Shared:** `packages/run_recorder/lib/src/gym_workout_runner.dart` (+ re-export). The mobile `exercise_history.dart` mirror is already landed (a tracked parity pair), so no new mirror work is needed there.

**Edge Function:** extend `export-data` + its completeness pgtap.

## Phasing & rollout

Four web-first, independently-shippable slices. Each ships value alone, mirrors to the twin only after web lands, and unlocks the next. Sizing is dev-days for one engineer including web + mobile twin + tests + docs.

### P1 — Reusable routines + "repeat last" (the gate probe) — ~4–5 days

**Scope.** A routine = a saved ordered list of planned exercises with target sets/reps/load (or RPE) — **no** progression, supersets, or execution loop. Two entries: "Save as routine" from a `gym_workouts` row, and "Repeat last" (prefill-only instantiate of the most recent matching session into `GymEditor`). The logged workout is untethered from the routine after instantiation (no adherence yet). New `/gym/routines` list + `/gym/routines/[id]` detail, both self-hiding.

**Why first.** Smallest schema, highest leverage, and **this slice is the validation gate** — "repeat last" needs no new table (reuses `gym_exercise_set_history` + `previousExerciseSession`) and validates the core bet before P2–P4 are committed.

**Schema (`20270101_001`).** `gym_workouts.metadata` column (prerequisite); `gym_routines`; `gym_routine_exercises` (carrying the `target_reps_min/max` range, `exercise_key`, `position`); `gym_routine_sets`. Author-only RLS; `(routine_id, set_index)` index. No narrow-union CHECK pair is *exercised* by P1 UI, but the columns + CHECKs land now (the full schema ships in one migration).

**Parity / store / tests.** `gym_routine` pair (`routineFromWorkout`, `prefillFromRoutine`). `LocalRoutineStore`. Playwright save-as-routine + repeat-last + self-hide; pgtap RLS + cascade; **`export-data` extended + its pgtap** (DSAR completeness, day one).

**Unlocks P2:** explicit `position` + `exercise_key` + `superset_group` columns are the grouping primitive P2 builds on.

### P2 — Richer structure (supersets, set types, rest, time/distance) — ~4 days

**Scope.** Expressive depth in the *template* only (still no execution, no progression): supersets (round-robin groups via `superset_group` / `superset_order`), set types (`set_type`), per-set `rest_s`, and non-rep modalities (`modality` = `time` / `distance` for holds/carries). Richer authoring in `RoutineEditor` (group/ungroup, set-type chips, rest field).

**Parity / tests.** Extend `gym_routine`: `expandRoutineSteps` → grouped/round-robin flat list with `rest` injected as an explicit step kind (the gym divergence from run's linear expansion). Register the `modality` + `set_type` narrow-union ↔ CHECK pairs (TS union + `check_constraint_unions.mjs`). Playwright superset group/ungroup + set-type chips; parity unit tests for round-robin expansion.

**Unlocks P3:** `expandRoutineSteps` is the exact input the runner consumes.

### P3 — Execution + adherence (mirror the run engine) — ~5–6 days

**Scope.** The `GymWorkoutRunner` on top of the gym session, consuming the P2 expansion, driving the execution band, persisting the `gym_workouts.metadata` trio (`routine_id`, `gym_step_results`, `gym_adherence`). **No new columns** — the trio rides the `metadata` column added in P1. Adherence is the per-axis 80% cutoff (reps/load, not pace). Dual-save crash safety.

**Parity / tests.** `gym_adherence` pair (the cutoff reducer). Runner tests in `packages/run_recorder/test/gym_workout_runner_test.dart`. `/audit:metadata-keys` must pass for the new trio. Twin byte-identical; Playwright for the band.

**Unlocks P4:** persisted `gym_step_results` over time is the signal a progression scheme reads.

### P4 — Progression schemes (the engine) — ~5–6 days

**Scope.** Per-exercise schemes prescribing the next session's targets from logged history. Ship the highest-value first: **linear**, **double_progression**, **five_by_five**, **percent_cycle**, **rpe_autoreg** (the `progression` column + `progression_params`). The `periodisation` (routine-level) and the four narrow-union CHECK pairs are already in `20270101_001`; P4 wires the engine. Coach-authored progression (if built) is **validated/clamped by the same pure `nextPrescription` guardrails** before write — the engine is authoritative, the LLM advisory.

**Parity / tests.** `gym_progression` pair, deterministic, identical edge cases + test count; `shared-library-syncer` after edits. `/audit:schema-drift` (CHECK↔union) must pass. Playwright for scheme selection + next-target preview.

> **Gate:** proceed to P2 only if P1's repeat-rate clears the owner threshold. P3/P4 follow on sustained engagement. If the signal is weak, freeze at P1.

## Open questions

1. **Free-text exercise identity.** Binding relies on `normaliseExerciseName` (the only grouping primitive); typos/renames break it and corrupt progression input. *Do we need a per-user exercise catalog/identity before P4, or is normalisation enough?* (The one genuinely missing primitive.)
2. **Gate jumped/relocated (see [§ gate](#the-validation-gate-stated-honestly)).** If repeat-rate is weak, P2–P4 are sunk cost — mitigated by making P1 the probe.
3. **Twin + parity tax compounds.** Three parity pairs + the runner each need byte-identical Dart + matched test counts; the likeliest sizing miss.
4. **`set_type` at the DB.** It's a column here (queryable). Confirm no screen needs to *aggregate* by set type in a way the current shape can't serve.
5. **Coach-authored progression data flow.** The LLM reads logged sets (health-adjacent). Confirm it stays within the existing coach data-handling envelope; loop in CISO if it widens what leaves the system (SOC 2 / GovRAMP).
6. **Tier-2 "command" trust.** P4 prescribes — clamp rules + a "confirm next target" step are mandatory; auto-apply is never allowed.
7. **`activities` view interaction.** Executed sessions remain `gym_workouts` rows feeding the UNION lift branch — confirmed the view enumerates `(id, user_id, kind, started_at, summary, is_public)` (not `select *`) so the new `metadata` column does not leak into the lift branch. Re-verify if the view is ever rewritten.
8. **Paywall.** Recommend **fully free** (manual authoring/execution/progression) — consistent with the empty `PRO_ONLY_FEATURES` and "Pro buys behaviour, not access." The only marginal-cost surface is Coach *writing* a routine (an LLM call) → gate **that write** via the existing per-tier daily coach cap, not a screen gate. Do **not** add a `PRO_ONLY_FEATURES` key. Surface the tradeoff (the manual engine is free, so Pro's gym pull is "let Coach build it faster"); a screen gate is the available-but-costly conversion lever that would break the "free reaches every screen" trust property.

## Rough sizing

| Slice | Dev-days (1 eng, web→mobile serial) |
|---|---|
| P1 — routines + repeat-last + DSAR export + store + tests | ~4–5 |
| P2 — supersets / set-types / rest / modalities + expansion | ~4 |
| P3 — `GymWorkoutRunner` + band + adherence + metadata trio | ~5–6 |
| P4 — progression schemes + Coach validation hook | ~5–6 |

**Total ~18–21 dev-days** if all four ship, serial. Parallelising web/mobile breaks the twin invariant, so the numbers assume serial. Realistically only P1 ships first; P2–P4 are gated on the engagement signal.

## Appendix A — `decisions.md` § 141

> **Landed as `decisions.md` § 141** (2026-06-11). This appendix originally reserved **§140**, but the session-plans ADR landed first and took §140, so the gym-programming ADR became **§141**. The text below is the design-of-record draft; the canonical landed entry is [decisions.md § 141](../architecture/decisions.md).

> **§141 — The gym programming engine ships as a four-slice, web-first depth tier that relocates the "measure gym engagement first" gate into its cheapest slice rather than jumping it.** Instead of a separate measurement-only phase, we sequence the engine so P1 (reusable routines + "repeat last", near-zero new schema) *is* the validation gate: if repeat-rate clears an owner-set threshold (~20% of gym sessions over 4–6 weeks) we proceed to P2 (supersets / set-types / rest / time-distance structure), P3 (a `GymWorkoutRunner` mirroring `WorkoutRunner` — on-top-of-session state machine, prescribed-vs-actual `gym_step_results` + `gym_adherence` trail in a newly-added `gym_workouts.metadata` jsonb column, adherence on reps/load at the run engine's 80%-of-target cutoff applied **per axis**, not pace), and P4 (linear / double-progression / 5×5 / %-of-e1RM / RPE-autoreg progression schemes; Coach-authored progression validated and clamped by the same pure prescriber). The plan is **relational** (`gym_routines` → `gym_routine_exercises` → `gym_routine_sets`) — the deliberate divergence from `plan_workouts.structure jsonb`, justified by per-exercise querying and row-by-row progression — with one jsonb escape hatch (`progression_params`). The plan→session link lives in `gym_workouts.metadata.routine_id` (a string, **not** an FK), so deleting a routine leaves prior sessions intact (immutable history) and the step-result shape evolves without a migration. Each slice is independently shippable and ends the flat-`set_index` reconstruction heuristic by introducing explicit `position` + `exercise_key` + `superset_group`. The manual engine is **fully free** (consistent with the empty `PRO_ONLY_FEATURES` and "free reaches every screen"); only Coach-*authored* progression is metered, via the existing per-tier daily coach cap, never a screen gate. If repeat-rate is weak we freeze at P1 (still a durable win — it ships "repeat last" and ends the reconstruction heuristic) and leave P2–P4 specced-but-unbuilt; the explicit tradeoff is faster-to-signal at the cost of building the routine schema before the gate formally clears.

## Appendix B — `roadmap.md` Phase-4 checklist edits

Flip the "Not in scope" bullet (verified exact text: `- [ ] **Not in scope:** exercise database, workout templates, programmes, RPE-driven progression (all in the gym depth tier below).` — find it by this text, not a line number; the design diff must keep the checkbox) into a planned, gated sub-phase. The *measure gym engagement* gate sentence in the Phase-4 sequencing block and the "Gym — heavy (full programming)" depth-tier heading stay as-is.

```diff
- - [ ] **Not in scope:** exercise database, workout templates, programmes, RPE-driven progression (all in the gym depth tier below).
+ - **Gym programming engine (depth tier, gated on engagement — ADR §141).**
+   Web-first, four independently-shippable slices; P1 is the validation probe
+   (relocates the "measure gym engagement" validation gate into its cheapest
+   slice rather than running a separate measurement phase). The lightweight
+   free-form log is unchanged.
+   - [ ] P1 — Reusable routines + "repeat last" (gym_routines /
+         gym_routine_exercises / gym_routine_sets; adds gym_workouts.metadata;
+         ends the flat set_index reconstruction heuristic). **Gate probe:
+         measure repeat-rate before P2.**
+   - [ ] P2 — Richer structure: supersets, set types, rest, time/distance
+         (superset_group + modality + set_type; the four narrow-union CHECK
+         pairs land here).
+   - [ ] P3 — Execution + adherence: GymWorkoutRunner mirroring WorkoutRunner;
+         routine_id / gym_step_results / gym_adherence in gym_workouts.metadata;
+         adherence on reps/load at the 80%-of-target cutoff, applied per axis.
+   - [ ] P4 — Progression schemes: linear / double / 5×5 / %-of-e1RM / RPE;
+         Coach-authored progression validated by the pure prescriber.
+         **Proceed only if P1 clears the engagement gate.**
+   - Paywall: manual engine fully free; only Coach-authored progression
+     metered via the existing per-tier daily coach cap (no screen gate).

## Exercise catalogue (mid-tier; additive)

**Shipped 2026-06-20** (web + mobile twin, migration `20270222_001`, decisions §176). The gym-mid roadmap's "exercise database (FK from `gym_sets.exercise_id` instead of free text)" bullet — built **additively**, never as a replacement, so existing free-text logs and the offline-first `LocalGymStore` path are untouched.

**Schema.** A new `public.exercises` table: `id`, nullable `author_id → auth.users` (NULL = a seeded global, read-only for everyone; set = an owner-created custom), `name`, `name_key` (= `normaliseExerciseName(name)`, stamped at write), `category` (chest/back/shoulders/legs/arms/core/cardio/full_body/other — narrow union ↔ CHECK), `modality` (reuses `GymExerciseModality`), `external_id`, `last_modified_at`, `created_at`. Two partial unique indexes keep the global (`where author_id is null`) and per-author namespaces independent. Seed = ~43 common compounds + isolations + cardio. **`gym_sets.exercise_id`** is a **nullable** FK with `on delete set null` — a logged set may reference a catalogue entry or stay free-text; `exercise_name` is always populated, and PR computation stays keyed on the normalised name, so the link is provenance, not the grouping key.

**RLS.** Read = `author_id is null or author_id = auth.uid()`; insert/update/delete = `author_id = auth.uid()` (can't mutate a global or forge another user's custom). Deleting a custom sets the logged set's `exercise_id` null (history immutable); deleting the owner cascades the custom away (Art 17).

**Wiring.** The composer (web `GymEditor.svelte` ← `fetchExerciseCatalogue`; mobile `gym_compose_sheet.dart` ← `ApiClient.fetchExerciseCatalogue` from `gym_screen.dart`) merges catalogue names into the existing history autocomplete and binds `exercise_id` only when the typed name matches a catalogue entry by normalised key. Custom-exercise create on web is `createCustomExercise` in `core/data.ts`. The `Exercise` overlay + `ExerciseCategory` union live in `apps/web/src/lib/types.ts`, both registered in `check_constraint_unions.mjs`.

**DSAR.** Only owner-created customs (`author_id = uid`) are exported (seeded globals are shared reference data), wired into both the Deno `backup_spec.ts` and the Go worker `exportPersonalDataSpecs`.

**Tests.** pgtap `exercises_rls_test.sql`; Playwright `gym/gym.spec.ts`; mobile `gym_compose_sheet_test.dart`. **Not built** (deferred): a catalogue browse/picker UI, muscle-group analytics off `category`, public/shared customs, and binding `exercise_id` from a routine step.
