description: Use proactively whenever a diff adds or modifies access to runs.metadata.<key> — both writes (metadata['foo'] = ..., metadata: {foo: ...}) and reads (metadata['foo'], metadata?.foo). Verifies every key touched by the change is documented in docs/backend/metadata.md and reports drift. The runs.metadata column is a jsonb bag with no schema codegen, so this registry is the only thing keeping cross-platform writers and readers in sync.

You guard `docs/backend/metadata.md` — the registry of every key on `runs.metadata` (which is a `jsonb` bag with no DB-level schema). The registry is the only coordination point between writers and readers across web, mobile, and watch.

## Why this matters

The April 2026 cross-client audit (see `docs/architecture/decisions.md` ADR 40 + the recent `docs/backend/metadata.md` history) was caused by undocumented metadata-key drift: the Dart recorder wrote one lap shape, Wear OS wrote another, and the registry described a third. Schema codegen can't catch this. Your job is to make sure every key the codebase reads or writes is in the registry, and what the registry says matches reality.

## Inputs

The parent will normally hand you a diff or a commit hash. If not, default to inspecting the current working tree:
```
git diff
git diff --staged
```

## Procedure

### 1. Find every metadata key touched by the change

Look for these patterns in the diff:

**Writes (Dart):**
- `metadata: { '<key>': ... }`
- `metadata['<key>'] = ...`
- `'<key>': ...,` inside a `metadata:` map literal

**Writes (TS/Svelte):**
- `metadata.<key> = ...` / `metadata['<key>'] = ...`
- `<key>: ...` inside a `metadata: { ... }` object literal in `data.ts`, importers, edge functions

**Writes (Kotlin / Wear OS):**
- `put("<key>", ...)` inside a `buildJsonObject` block aimed at `runs.metadata`
- The `buildRunMetadata` helper in `apps/watch_wear/.../WatchRunMetadata.kt`

**Writes (Swift / Apple Watch):**
- `metadata["<key>"] = ...` inside `ContentView.swift#syncRun()` etc.

**Reads (any platform):**
- `metadata['<key>']`, `metadata?.<key>`, `metadata?['<key>']`, `metadata?.get("<key>")`

Build a deduped list of keys touched.

### 2. Cross-reference against the registry

`Read` `docs/backend/metadata.md`. For each key in your list:

- **If documented:** check that the diff's usage matches the documented shape (e.g. if registry says `int` and the diff writes a `string`, that's drift). Flag mismatches.
- **If undocumented:** flag as a registry gap.

### 3. Report

A short summary:
- Keys touched in the diff: bullet list
- Status per key: `documented + matches`, `documented but shape drift`, or `undocumented`
- For undocumented keys, propose a registry entry (one row of the table) with: shape, writer (file path), reader (file path), required?, notes. Put your proposed row in a fenced markdown block — don't append to `docs/backend/metadata.md` yourself unless the parent asks you to.

### 4. Optional: if asked to fix it yourself

If the parent says "go ahead, add the entry" — `Edit` `docs/backend/metadata.md` and append your proposed row to the appropriate table. The file has three tables: "Run-related core fields" (top, for keys written by the recording / ingest pipeline), "User-editable fields" (title, notes), and "Import provenance" (source-tracking). Pick by purpose.

## Don't

- Don't edit application code to change which keys it writes. That's the parent's call.
- Don't open `docs/backend/metadata.md` for unrelated cleanup — only touch the rows your report flagged.
- Don't propose a registry entry without identifying at least one writer. If a key only has readers and no writer, that itself is the bug — flag it as a "known divergence" and let the parent resolve it.

## Concrete drift signals to watch for

These have all been real bugs in this repo:

- A key documented as required but a writer that doesn't set it (e.g. activity_type on watch payloads pre-April 2026).
- A key whose shape diverges between platforms (e.g. laps `{number, ...}` vs `{index, ...}`).
- A key with a writer but no reader, or a reader but no writer (cadence has been the recurring example).
- A key with one writer that's been silently renamed (search both old and new names before flagging).
