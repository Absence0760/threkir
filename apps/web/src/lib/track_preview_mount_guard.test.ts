// `TrackPreview` takes a points array and draws it. It has no visibility gate
// and no clip, so mounting it with a row's own `waypoints` on a surface whose
// viewer is not the owner is the pre-audit shape that leaked bookmarked, club
// and public routes (decisions.md § 33), and it is the shape § 772's filing
// would have rebuilt if it had been implemented literally.
//
// `privacy_guards.test.ts` pins four SURFACES off it by name — the routes
// list, the clubs Routes tab, `/routes/[id]` and the DM thread. Four named
// surfaces is a list, and § 738's standing lesson is that a list rots: the
// fifth non-owner surface to want a route thumbnail is invisible to all four
// assertions. This derives the rule instead — only the clip-aware wrappers
// may mount the renderer — and holds each of them to still clipping, so an
// entry cannot stay permitted after it stops earning it.
