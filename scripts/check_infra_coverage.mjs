// Guardrail: nothing under infra/ is unwatched — every stack is validated and
// dependency-tracked, and every Lambda the web stack creates is alarmed.
//
// Both halves close the same gap in different places: a hand-maintained list
// that has to be edited for a new thing to be covered, with nothing failing
// when it is not.
//
//   1. Stack coverage. `.github/workflows/terraform.yml` expands its stacks as
//      an inline `stack:` matrix and its header says "when adding a new stack:
//      append it to the matrix below AND add a terraform ecosystem entry to
//      .github/dependabot.yml". A stack absent from the matrix gets no
//      `validate` of its own; one absent from dependabot never hears about a
//      provider CVE. Neither absence shows up as a red check — the workflow
//      simply has one fewer green row than it could have, which is invisible
//      next to the twenty it does have.
//
//      infra/modules/web-stack is the one directory that cannot be validated
//      on its own: it takes an `aws.us_east_1` aliased provider from its
//      caller, so a standalone `terraform validate` fails with "Provider
//      configuration not present" (measured, not assumed, and still true under
//      `configuration_aliases`). It is exempt here WITH that reason, and the
//      exemption fails if it ever stops being needed.
//
//      The exemption is from `validate` and from NOTHING ELSE. `fmt` has no
//      such excuse — formatting a module needs no provider — and it was
//      nonetheless skipped for a year, because the fmt step lived inside the
//      matrix job with a per-stack `working-directory` and `terraform fmt`
//      without `-recursive` reads one directory. Measured: drift added to
//      infra/modules/web-stack left all five per-stack steps exiting 0.
//      So the fmt invocations are read out of the workflow as SCOPES — a
//      directory plus whether `-recursive` extends it over the subtree — and
//      every Terraform directory must fall inside one, exempt or not.
//      decisions § 1111.
//
//      That whole half is scoped to `infra/`, which is also the answer it
//      assumes: the walk starts there, so a `.tf` file in some other tree is
//      not reported as uncovered, it is not seen. Nothing else would see it
//      either — ci.yml's `changes` job gates the `terraform` call on an
//      `infra/`-shaped path filter inherited from the old workflow trigger, so
//      such a stack is format-checked, validated, Trivy-scanned and TRIGGERED
//      by nothing, and reads as covered because nothing looks. A second sweep
//      therefore runs from the repo ROOT and fails on any Terraform directory
//      outside `infra/`, which turns "a stack somewhere else" into a red check
//      and leaves the path filter honest at `infra/` rather than widened to a
//      tree that does not exist. Today there is none (measured), so the sweep's
//      verdict is an absence — and an absence from a walk that never started is
//      worth nothing, which is why the sweep also reports whether it saw
//      `infra/` at the top level.
//
//   2. Distribution behaviour coverage. The CloudFront distribution carries
//      eighteen cache behaviours and every one of them re-states, by hand, the
//      three properties that make it safe: the security response-headers policy
//      (the CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options and Permissions-Policy live there and
//      nowhere else), an https viewer-protocol policy, and the viewer-request
//      function association that redirects `www.` to the apex. None of the
//      three is inherited — CloudFront applies a response-headers policy and an
//      edge function PER BEHAVIOUR — so a nineteenth behaviour that omits one
//      serves that path with no CSP at all, or serves the whole site at a
//      second host on that path. `www_redirect.js` had already shipped serving
//      `WWW.threkir.com` for a year with nothing executing it (decisions § 894);
//      this is the same function stopping at a path instead of at a casing, and
//      the failure looks identical from the outside: a page that renders.
//
//   3. Lambda alarm coverage. A failing Lambda origin on this distribution is
//      invisible. CloudFront models custom error responses per distribution
//      rather than per behaviour, so the SPA `403 → /index.html at 200`
//      fallback rewrites a Lambda-origin error too — issue #590 measured
//      exactly that, a Function URL 403ing before invocation while the page
//      still rendered. The CloudWatch alarms are the only signal those
//      failures have, and osrm-proxy shipped without the p95 one its own
//      comment claimed it mirrored from generate-route.
//
//   4. Error-response honesty. `custom_error_response` is the one place on this
//      distribution where a status code can be laundered, and because it is
//      distribution-wide it launders EVERY origin's at once. A mapping that
//      answers a 4xx/5xx with a 2xx tells a crawler the page is fine — which is
//      what the 404 -> 200 mapping did to ten `/share/*` paths, turning every
//      private, deleted or never-existing entity into a soft 404 Google was
//      invited to index, with the `noindex` that would have said otherwise
//      sitting in a Lambda body the rewrite discards (decisions § 1022). One
//      such mapping is legitimate and is declared here with its reason: the
//      SPA's 403 deep-link path, where S3's GetObject-only bucket policy makes
//      a missing key a 403 and every dynamic client route a missing key. Any
//      other status-laundering mapping fails, and a declared exemption nothing
//      uses fails too — the RESOURCELESS_ACTIONS shape, one file over.
//
//   5. WAF scope-down normalisation. The three rate-based rules are the only
//      thing bounding spend on the only three paths that cost money or engine
//      CPU to serve, and each is scoped down by a STARTS_WITH match on
//      `uri_path` — a field WAF does not decode, while CloudFront's behaviour
//      matching normalises independently. A scope-down with no URL_DECODE
//      transformation lets an encoded spelling reach the Lambda with the
//      per-IP cap unapplied, and looks identical in the console to one that
//      does not (decisions § 1023). A fourth rule copy-pasted from the first
//      three inherits the gap silently, which is what this claim is for.
//
//   6. Engine-URL symmetry. The module takes three routing-engine URLs, each a
//      string input defaulting to "" (the value that means "no engine, degrade
//      gracefully"). An env root that cannot SET one cannot rehearse a prod
//      change that involves it — which is what a preview environment is for —
//      and the omission is invisible: the module receives "" either way, the
//      plan is identical, and nothing reads as missing. `graph_cycle_url` was
//      in exactly that state (decisions § 1024): declared and wired in
//      envs/prod, declared nowhere in envs/preview, with no recorded reason
//      while its two siblings carried one. The engine set is DERIVED from the
//      module (a `_url` string input whose default is "") rather than listed,
//      so a fourth engine is covered the day it is added. The three deliberate
//      prod-only knobs measured alongside it — the reserved-concurrency caps —
//      are literals in preview WITH a stated reason and are not this shape.
//
// Offline by design: a directory listing and six files. No AWS credentials,
// no `terraform init`.
//
// Run: `node scripts/check_infra_coverage.mjs`
// CI:  the `infra-guards` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml, which is in the
//      `CI gate` aggregator's `needs:` list.
// Unit tests: `node --test scripts/check_infra_coverage.test.mjs`
