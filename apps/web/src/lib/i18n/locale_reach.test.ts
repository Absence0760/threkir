 * apps/mobile_android/test/architecture_guards_test.dart (decisions § 782); this
 * is web's half of the same pair (§ 784).
 *
 * The markers split into two kinds and only one kind can be listed, so this is
 * two tests. A [TU_MARKERS] entry is a form no other person, tense or part of
 * speech spells the same way, which makes a token list exact. The affirmative
 * imperative is the other kind and is unlistable: its tu form is letter-for-
 * letter the third-person present indicative, so `Adiciona um peso` (tu, *add a
 * weight*) and `a app adiciona um peso` (*the app adds a weight*) are the same
 * word, and any token banning it fires on ordinary prose. That half is derived
 * against the Brazilian catalogue instead — see the second test.
 *
 * Two words are deliberately absent because they are NOT tu-only here, and both
 * are live in both catalogues: `precisas` is `precisar` in the tu form and the
 * feminine plural of `preciso` (`runDetail.hrDisclaimerSuffix`, "para zonas
 * precisas"), and `aceitas` is `aceitar` in the tu form and the feminine plural
 * participle (`settingsAccount.aiConsentUpdatedToast`, "Informações de IA
 * atualizadas aceitas"). Bare `tu` is absent for the opposite reason — a label
 * whose whole value names the reader is not a possessive in running prose, and
 * pt-PT deliberately ships `clubEvent.youTag` as `(tu)` and `messages.youPrefix`
 * as `Tu: ` after § 760 put the pronoun back into them.

/**
 * A sentence assembled from several catalogue keys around a link or a `<strong>`

 * with a LEADING space, because a `<strong>Eu consinto</strong>` renders
 * immediately before it. The § 755 derivation walked `pt-BR.ts` word by word and
 * treated each value as a sentence of its own, so 19 of these lost the space and
 * were sentence-cased — "Clique em **Eu consinto**Para continuar." — and three
 * more lost their last word entirely when the subject-pronoun elision deleted
 * `você` and left the trailing space behind ("Um pouco sobre ").
 *
 * Measured against `pt-BR.ts` rather than against English, and only for these
 * two: an en-anchored rule needs exemptions the moment it meets German (a
 * fragment attaching with a comma needs no space) or Japanese (which sets no
 * word spaces at all), while the two Portuguese catalogues share a syntax and
 * pt-PT is a derivation OF pt-BR, so an edge that differs is an artifact of the
 * derivation and never a translation choice. No list, no threshold.
 *
 * The initial CASE is still not checked here, and now for a narrower reason
 * than § 784's. The 248 were read one call site at a time and 208 lowercased
 * (§ 872); the 21 left are label positions where the capital is right. What
 * separates them is where the string renders — after a `<kbd>`, under a value,
 * inside a badge — which a catalogue cannot see and which pt-BR cannot answer
 * either, since Brazilian is lowercase in both classes. The subset whose
 * position IS a catalogue fact is the one a value interpolates into another
 * value, and that is guarded below rather than here.

/**
 * Determiners that cannot stand before the noun they are written against,

 *
 * The first is a European Portuguese substitution that changes the noun's
 * GENDER, which the § 755 corpus applied word-for-word and did not carry into
 * the article agreeing with it: Brazilian `a tela` is European `o ecrã`, and
 * `os compartilhamentos` are `as partilhas`. Both were live — "Manter a ecrã
 * ligada", "ocultado dos partilhas públicos".
 *
 * The second is a `{noun}` slot filled from a set that is not one gender. The
 * report dialog's title was one string per locale — "Denunciar este {noun}",
 * "Signaler ce {noun}", "Diese {noun} melden" — against seven nouns of which
 * four are feminine in Portuguese and Spanish, two are feminine in French and
 * four are masculine or neuter in German, so every locale but `en` and `ja`
 * rendered the wrong determiner on some of them. It is now a title per target
 * kind, which is what puts the determiner in the same string as the noun it
 * governs and therefore inside this guard's reach (§ 1060).
 *
 * Determiners only. They are closed classes, so the scan is exact; an adjective
 * would need a morphology this guard has no business carrying, and the
 * determiner is already immediately before the noun in every one of these.
 *
 * A determiner is listed only where it is wrong in EVERY reading. French plural
 * `les` / `ces` / `aux` carry no gender at all and were dropped after they
 * reported 31 correct strings; German is listed by exact singular, because the
 * genitive takes an `-s` on the noun (`dieses Clubs`) and matching `Clubs` would
 * report it — and only the demonstratives no case licenses are named, so
 * `dieser Lauf` (nominative) and `diesem Lauf` (dative) stand.
