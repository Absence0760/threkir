// Lightweight shared-storage handoff between the WatchApp main target
// (which owns the HKWorkoutSession) and the Complication widget
// extension target (which only needs to render numbers).
//
// Lives under WatchApp/ rather than Complications/ because both
// targets need to compile this type. The complication target is added
// in Xcode (see Complications/README.md) with target-membership on
// this file ticked for both WatchApp and the new ComplicationExtension.
//
// The complication can't pull data directly from `WorkoutManager`
// because each widget extension runs in its own process — they don't
// share memory with the host app. The standard fix on watchOS is an
// **App Group** + a shared `UserDefaults`: the host app writes a tiny
// snapshot whenever the workout state changes, and the complication
// reads it on every timeline request.
//
// Why a 5-field snapshot instead of just `workoutManager.something`:
//
//  - Per-tick GPS deltas would burn complication-refresh budget. We
//    only re-snapshot on stage transitions (start, pause, resume,
//    stop) and at half-km / 30 s ticks.
//  - The complication target stays decoupled from HealthKit /
//    CoreLocation — much smaller binary, simpler entitlements.
//  - The same on-disk shape can later be consumed by an iOS Lock
//    Screen widget without dragging the workout types along.
