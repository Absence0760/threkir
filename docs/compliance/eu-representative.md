# EU representative

GDPR Art 27 requires controllers and processors **without an establishment in the EU** to designate a representative in the EU when they offer goods or services to EU data subjects, or monitor their behaviour.

The representative is named in the Privacy Policy and is the first contact point for EU supervisory authorities and data subjects in the EU.

**Status**: not appointed, by decision (2026-10-06, issue #1061 M6) — kept as a later option, not a launch blocker. The Privacy Policy says plainly that no representative is appointed and points EU / UK residents and authorities at `privacy@threkir.com` (`NOT_PROVIDED` in `apps/web/src/lib/legal/operator.ts`). The obligation applies when the service is offered to people in the EU / UK; excluding those countries from store availability is the consistent way to hold this position. Revisit before any EU / UK rollout.

## Who qualifies

- A natural person or legal entity **established in an EU member state** where data subjects live.
- Authorised in writing (a contractual mandate) to represent us under GDPR.
- Not necessarily a lawyer — many GDPR-rep firms specialise in this.

## Common options

| Vendor | Indicative annual cost (verify current) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **VeraSafe** | ~€500-2000 | Active in this market; Ireland-based |
| **GDPR Representative Limited** | ~€800-1500 | UK + Ireland |
| **EDPO** (European Data Protection Office) | ~€500-1500 | Belgium-based |
| **DPO Center Ltd** | varies | Combines DPO + Art 27 rep |

This list is for orientation only. Get current quotes; verify the rep firm's standing with at least one supervisory authority's published list.

## UK GDPR (Art 27) — separate appointment

Brexit means the UK has its own UK GDPR. If we offer services to UK data subjects without a UK establishment, we need a **UK representative** *in addition* to the EU one. Multiple firms (e.g. VeraSafe) act in both jurisdictions.

## What to record once appointed

Update this doc with:

- Legal name of the representative entity.
- Establishment address (must be within the EU; same for UK rep).
- Contact email + phone.
- Contract execution date.
- Renewal date.
- Liability + indemnification terms (the rep can be jointly liable with us under Art 27(5) — confirm scope).

Then update:

- The Privacy Policy footer + DSAR section.
- The Cookie Notice if it cites the controller separately.
- App Store Connect → App Privacy → Privacy Contact (Apple uses this for any EU regulator inquiry).
- Play Console → App content → Data safety → Privacy Policy URL (which itself lists the rep).
- The signature block on any DPA with EU sub-processors.

## When this matters in practice

- A **supervisory-authority inquiry** under Art 31. The SA may write to the rep instead of us. Set up automatic forwarding to `privacy@<your-domain>`.
- A **data-subject Art 12 inquiry**. Users in the EU can write to the rep instead of us; same forwarding rule.
- An **Art 33 breach notification**. We must be reachable through the rep; some SAs require the notification *from* the rep.

The rep's standing offer is the cleanest "ask counsel if unsure" answer — the rep firms specialise in this and answer this question for a living.
