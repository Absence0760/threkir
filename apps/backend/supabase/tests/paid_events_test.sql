-- Pins migration 20261229_001 (paid events, slice P1 — the money ledger):
--   * event_orders RLS: a buyer reads their own orders; a host (event
--     organiser) reads orders for their events; a third party reads neither.
--   * event_orders writes are SERVICE-ROLE ONLY — a user-JWT cannot insert an
--     order nor flip its status (the subscription_tier lock pattern).
--   * event_pricing requires the host to have a charges-enabled payout account
--     (trigger-enforced, not just UI) — a direct write with no charges-enabled
--     account is rejected.
--   * the paid-order-required-for-priced-going rule — a going / waitlisted row
--     on a priced event without a paid order is rejected; a free event is
--     unaffected.
