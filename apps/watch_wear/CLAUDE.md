# watch_wear — AI session notes

**Pure Kotlin Wear OS app** using Jetpack Compose-for-Wear. **Not Flutter.**
The Flutter build was removed when the team committed to Compose-for-Wear
native UI (see [../../docs/architecture/decisions.md § 15](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md)).

## Scope — read before writing code

**Web is the canonical feature surface; the watch is a wrist-only complement,
not a parallel client.** See [../../docs/architecture/decisions.md § 24](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md#24-web-is-the-canonical-feature-surface-mobile-and-watches-are-platform-additive)
and the live matrix at [../../docs/product/parity.md](../../docs/product/parity.md). Watch
columns in `parity.md` are `N/A` for almost everything by design — the watch
is **not** trying to mirror web's feature surface.

**Build here:**

- **Wrist-only capabilities**: standalone `HKWorkoutSession`-equivalent via
  Health Services, `FusedLocationProviderClient` background recording,
  on-device crash recovery, on-watch HR via Health Services `MeasureClient`,
  haptic pace alerts, route preview on-watch, ambient-mode rendering, watch
  faces / tiles / complications.
- **Direct cloud sync** of completed runs (the watch posts straight to
  Supabase via `SupabaseClient.kt` — no phone hop). Schema-typed against the
  same Supabase migrations via the generated `DbRows.kt`.

**Don't build here:**

- Anything that belongs in a pocket app: history browse, settings panels,
  social feed, club detail, plan editing, photo upload, OAuth setup. The
  watch is a recording surface and a status surface — not a phone in a
  smaller form factor. If a feature can wait for the runner to be near
  their phone, it doesn't go on the watch.
- A feature that doesn't exist on web yet. Same web-first rule as Android /
  iOS — you don't pioneer a feature on the watch.
- A Flutter or React-Native UI layer. The decision to be native Kotlin +
  Compose-for-Wear is in [§ 15](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md). Don't reintroduce
  Flutter even for "shared code" reasons.
- Hand-edits to `generated/DbRows.kt`. Schema changes regenerate it via
  `dart run scripts/gen_dart_models.dart` — see "Schema drift protection"
  below.
- New layout abstractions or DI frameworks. `RunViewModel` + Compose state
  is the entire UI stack. Adding Hilt / Koin / Anvil is out of scope.

## Schema drift protection

`RunRow` in `generated/DbRows.kt` is emitted by `scripts/gen_dart_models.dart`
from the Supabase migrations alongside the Dart `db_rows.dart`. Same
generator, same parse, two emitters — schema changes regenerate both. Renaming
`runs.distance_m` to, say, `runs.distance_metres` in a migration regenerates
the Kotlin file and breaks `SupabaseClient.saveRun` at compile time, exactly
like it breaks Dart callers of `RunRow`.

**If you change the `runs` schema**: run `dart run scripts/gen_dart_models.dart`.
Both outputs are committed. CI's `parity-types` job checks the TypeScript
file; the Dart and Kotlin emitters currently lean on `dart analyze` (Dart)
and `./gradlew compileDebugKotlin` (Kotlin) catching drift locally. A CI
hook that re-runs the generator and fails on uncommitted diff is a TODO.

If you add a new table that Wear OS writes to, add it to `_kotlinTables`
in `gen_dart_models.dart`.

## Sync architecture

Wear OS watches are standalone-capable (WiFi + optional cellular), so the
watch talks to Supabase directly — no paired-phone handoff, no Wearable
Data Layer proxy. `SupabaseClient` is a thin OkHttp wrapper:

1. `signIn(email, password)` → POST `/auth/v1/token?grant_type=password`, stashes access token + user id in memory.
2. `saveRun(...)` → gzips the track JSON, uploads to `/storage/v1/object/runs/{user_id}/{run_id}.json.gz` with `x-upsert: true` (idempotent overwrite — the track object is keyed deterministically, so a retry after a partial-success save must overwrite it, not `409 Duplicate`; mirrors mobile's `upsert: true` and `buildUploadTrackRequest` pins the header), then POSTs the row to `/rest/v1/runs` with `Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates,return=minimal`. Both halves are now idempotent, so a run whose row POST failed drains cleanly on the next attempt instead of wedging the queue. Matches the Dart `ApiClient.saveRun` contract byte-for-byte so the web/Android apps read Wear-produced runs without special cases.

**Primary path — phone handoff.** Auth comes from the paired Android phone
over the Wearable Data Layer. `mobile_android` pushes `{access_token,
refresh_token, user_id, base_url, anon_key, expires_at_ms}` to
`/supabase_session` whenever Supabase's `onAuthStateChange` fires;
`SessionBridge` on the watch receives it and `SessionStore` caches it to
DataStore so a cold launch while offline still has credentials. **The receive
side grades before it applies** (`decisions.md § 879`): `fromDataMapOrNull`
refuses a push whose access token, refresh token, user id, base URL or anon key
is missing or blank, because the accept path SAVES over the encrypted cached
session and sets `authed = true` — so a half-formed push used to destroy the one
credential an out-of-range watch still had and then hide the sign-in affordance
behind it. A refusal drops the event rather than emitting `SessionEvent.Cleared`:
`Cleared` runs `tearDownSession`, which wipes the unsynced-run queue, so treating
a corrupt frame as a sign-out would be worse than the bug. `DataLayerContractTest`
compares the path and the `DataMap` key set against the phone's writer, in both
directions.
`RunViewModel.refreshIfExpired` exchanges the refresh token for a new
access token automatically, and `drainQueue` retries once on HTTP 401 by
refreshing then re-pushing.

**Fallback — direct sign-in on the watch.** For standalone Wear OS
users (LTE watch, no paired Android phone), the pre-run screen has a
"Sign in" button that opens a Compose email/password form
(`Stage.SignIn` in the ViewModel). Calls the same `SupabaseClient.signIn`
path that the seed-creds fallback used to use, and stores the resulting
session in `SessionStore` so it's indistinguishable from a
phone-handed-over session for the rest of the lifecycle. Typing an email
on a 46mm screen is awful; the docs say so explicitly. Use it only when
you don't have a paired Android phone.

**Sign-out lifecycle.** `RunViewModel.tearDownSession()` is the single
point where every per-user cache on the watch is wiped (it runs for both
the user-initiated `signOut` and the phone-side `SessionEvent.Cleared`
signal): in-memory Supabase credentials, the **encrypted** session
(`SessionStore`, now `EncryptedSharedPreferences` — the access + refresh
tokens are bearer credentials, never plaintext on disk), the route cache
(`LocalRouteStore`), the upload queue **and its on-disk track files**
(`LocalRunStore.clear()`), and the map-tile cache (`TileSource.clear()`).
Clearing the run queue on sign-out is **fail-closed against cross-user
upload** — `drainQueue` uploads under whatever session is current at
drain time, so a run left queued across a sign-out would post user A's
GPS trace into user B's account. The trade-off is that an offline,
not-yet-synced run is dropped on sign-out; in practice the queue drains
on every run-stop and every offline→online edge, so it's normally empty
before a deliberate sign-out.

**At-rest / cloud backup.** The manifest sets `android:allowBackup="false"`,
so none of the on-device data (the queued-run track files, the DataStore
run metadata + route cache, the `EncryptedSharedPreferences` session blob)
is swept into Android Auto-Backup — a restored encrypted blob would be
undecryptable on a new device anyway, since its Keystore master key never
leaves the original watch. `BackupExclusionManifestTest.kt` pins the flag;
OS-level FBE covers the lost/stolen-device case. See [decisions.md § 127](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md).

Offline runs persist in `LocalRunStore` (DataStore, `watch_wear` prefs,
key `queued_runs_v2`). `RunViewModel.drainQueue()` fires on app start after
auth succeeds, after every run stops, on every offline→online edge from
`system/NetworkWatcher.kt`, and on user tap of the "Sync N runs"
`CompactChip` at the top of `PreRunScreen` (which calls `vm.sync()` —
same drain path with a `syncing` UI flag for the spinner).

## Heart rate

`HeartRateMonitor` registers a `MeasureCallback` on
`HealthServices.getClient(context).measureClient` for
`DataType.HEART_RATE_BPM` and exposes a `Flow<Int>` of live samples.
`RunRecordingService` folds the samples into a rolling `bpmSum`/`bpmCount`
pair, grades it on stop, and writes `avg_bpm` into `run.metadata` before
upload. Behaviour matches `watch_ios`'s HealthKit integration —
[docs/backend/metadata.md](../../docs/backend/metadata.md) registers the key.

**The mean is graded against how much of the run produced it.**
`MeasureClient` is documented foreground-only ([decisions § 1015](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md)),
so the samples reaching the pair on a twelve-hour ultra can be the minutes the
runner spent looking at the watch — and `avg_bpm` was saved as *the run's*
average either way. `recording/HeartRateCoverage.kt` is the pure grader both
producers of an average go through (the normal stop and `recoverCheckpoint`):
it writes `metadata.hr_coverage`, the share of ACTIVE elapsed time the sensor
was delivering, and suppresses `avg_bpm` below `MIN_AVG_BPM_COVERAGE` (0.5),
because a mean over less of the run than not is not the run's average. Coverage
is accumulated on the recording ticker against the AGE of the last usable
sample, not by closing an interval on an availability event — a foreground-only
client the platform stops feeding can go quiet without ever reporting
`UNAVAILABLE`. A null coverage is *unmeasured*, not zero: a checkpoint written
by a build predating the field recovers its average unqualified.
[decisions § 1083](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md).

## Running it locally

See [local_testing.md](local_testing.md).

## Deploying to production

See [deployment.md](deployment.md) — separate Play listing under `app.threkir.watchwear`, separate upload keystore from the phone app, shared Play service account, observability, rollback, DR.

Build and install on a Wear OS emulator (after `npm run dev:core` from the repo
root starts the local stack + runs `adb reverse` for the watch):

```bash
cd apps/watch_wear/android
./gradlew installDebug
```

That works on a fresh clone with **no `-P` flags**: the committed
`apps/watch_wear/android/.env.local` is applied by the `debug` build type
(local-stack Supabase on `127.0.0.1:54321`, seed-user auto-login, local
Protomaps tiles). A **release** build reads `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
from `-P` flags instead (the release workflow injects production values) and
ignores `.env.local` entirely:

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease -PSUPABASE_URL=https://staging.example.co -PSUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
```

## Dev-only env flags (`.env.local`)

`apps/watch_wear/android/.env.local` is **committed** with local-stack defaults
(public Supabase demo key, `127.0.0.1` URLs, `BYPASS_LOGIN=true`, local tiles).
It is read at Gradle-configure time and emitted as `BuildConfig` constants **by
the `debug` build type only** — `defaultConfig`/`release` use a hardcoded
safe-for-release baseline, so nothing here can leak into a release artifact.
Edit it locally for a real MapTiler/Sentry key but **don't commit the change**
(`git update-index --skip-worktree` it). Changes require a rebuild
(`./gradlew installDebug`).

Boolean flags accept the repo's set — `1`, `true`, `yes`, `on`, trimmed and
case-insensitive — and nothing else, matching `apps/web/src/lib/core/env_flag.ts`
and `apps/mobile_android/lib/env_flag.dart`. `EnvFlagParityTest` reads the
accepted set off the web rail rather than restating it, so a fifth affirmative
added there fails here rather than leaving this rail behind
(`decisions.md § 880`).

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `BYPASS_LOGIN` | `false` | On app start, if no cached session and no phone handoff, auto-sign-in as `runner@test.com` / `testtest`. Skips the sign-in screen. Use only against local/dev Supabase. **Not a sign-out switch**: flipping to `false` won't sign out a user whose session is already cached — tap the "Sign out" chip on PreRun or `./gradlew uninstallDebug && ./gradlew installDebug` to get a clean slate. |
| `DISABLE_HR` | `false` | HR (Health Services `MeasureClient` → `avg_bpm` in run metadata) defaults **ON** so real watches record heart rate (persona samsung #33 — the old default-off shipped every release with HR silently disabled). Set `DISABLE_HR=true` **only on the emulator**, which synthesises fake HR samples that look real and would otherwise pollute the runs table. The `BuildConfig` field is still `ENABLE_HR` (now `!DISABLE_HR`); consumers are unchanged. |
| `PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY` | `""` | MapTiler raster tile API key. When set, `ui/RouteMiniMap.kt` fetches `streets-v2-dark` tiles via `ui/TileSource.kt` and draws them under the polyline using the same Web Mercator projection (`recording/MercatorTiles.kt`). Empty ⇒ map falls back to polyline + position dot on a midnight background — same behaviour as v1. The env-var name matches the web app's so a single key can be shared across web and watch. |

The UI tracks the flags: with `ENABLE_HR` off, the BPM row on the Running
screen and the "N bpm avg" line on PostRun both disappear rather than
showing placeholder text that would train you to trust an emptyish reading.

## Dependency versions

Versions are pinned to latest stable as of April 2026, except where an
API we need only exists on a pre-stable build (Health Services rc,
security-crypto alpha — each called out below). Key points:

- **AGP 9.1.0** + **Gradle 9.4.1**. AGP 9 removed the `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android` plugin — it's now built-in — and removed the `kotlinOptions {}` DSL block in favour of `kotlin { compilerOptions { jvmTarget.set(JvmTarget.JVM_17) } }`. Both changes are reflected in the root plugin list + `app/build.gradle.kts`.
- **Kotlin 2.3.21** (compose + serialization plugins, pinned in `settings.gradle.kts`). Kotlin 2.0+ means the Compose Compiler is a Kotlin plugin (`org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose`), versioned with Kotlin itself. **The Kotlin version is capped by CodeQL's extractor, not by anything on this watch.** Bumping past the cap does not degrade the scan — it fails the `codeql-kotlin` job in `.github/workflows/security.yml` outright, from inside a `compileDebugKotlin` task, so the whole `java-kotlin` analysis is lost. Dependabot's `minor-and-patch` group shipped exactly that (PR #68) and reddened Security on `main`; it is held by an `ignore: >=2.4.0` rule on both plugins in `.github/dependabot.yml`. **The cap has since moved and this pin has not**: the bundle the pinned `github/codeql-action` SHA ships is CodeQL 2.27.0, whose extractor refuses only ≥ 2.4.20 ("Kotlin version 2.4.20 is too recent. CodeQL currently supports versions below 2.4.20", measured against the real CLI in [decisions § 1672](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md)). So 2.4.0 and 2.4.10 are analysable today and the `>=2.4.0` ignore is tighter than the fact requires — left deliberately conservative, since moving this app's Kotlin is an AGP-and-compose-compiler decision of its own. When you take it: relax the ignore to `>=2.4.20`, bump both plugin lines here together with the compose-compiler, and let `build-watch-wear` prove the toolchain. The base Kotlin compiler is the one AGP 9.x bundles; the compose-compiler plugin version must match it, so move both plugins together.
- **Compose BOM 2026.03.01** pins core Compose artifacts; **Wear Compose 1.6.1** (material / foundation / navigation) is declared separately because it's not under the core BOM.
- **Health Services 1.1.0-rc01**. Last stable is 1.0.0 but lacks some of the APIs we rely on; bump to 1.1.0 stable when it ships.
- **security-crypto 1.1.0-alpha06** (`EncryptedSharedPreferences` for the auth session — see `SessionStore.kt`). Deliberately NOT on the last stable (1.0.0): 1.0.0 predates the `MasterKey.Builder` API and only exposes the deprecated `MasterKeys` helper. The whole `androidx.security.crypto` line has had no release past 1.1.0-alpha06 in a long time, so there's no stable to bump to yet — revisit if/when a 1.1.0 beta/stable ships. This is the one dep NOT on a stable channel by choice rather than necessity.
- **OkHttp 5.3.2**. OkHttp 5 made `ResponseBody` non-nullable (`response.body.string()` instead of `response.body?.string()`) — one ergonomic break to watch for when adding network code.
- **compileSdk 37** / **targetSdk 35** / **minSdk 30**. `androidx.lifecycle:*-compose 2.11.0` requires compileSdk 37 (AGP 9.2.1 + Gradle 9.6 support it); Health Services requires minSdk 30; Wear OS 3 is the realistic deployment floor regardless.

When bumping, regenerate the codegen afterwards (`dart run scripts/gen_dart_models.dart`) and build both `./gradlew assembleDebug` and `./gradlew assembleRelease`.

## Gradle JDK quirk

Homebrew's default JDK on this machine is 25; Gradle 8.14's embedded Kotlin
compiler can't parse that version string and fails the whole build with a
cryptic `IllegalArgumentException: 25.0.2`. `gradle.properties` pins
`org.gradle.java.home` to the JDK bundled inside Android Studio (JBR 21).
If Android Studio lives somewhere other than `/Applications/Android Studio.app`
on your machine, override that line locally.

## Production reliability (Phase 4)

The recording loop lives in **`RunRecordingService`** — a foreground
service with `foregroundServiceType="location"`, a sticky notification,
and a partial wake-lock — not in the ViewModel's coroutine scope. This
is what lets a run survive the activity being destroyed (ambient mode,
backgrounding, low-memory kills).

- `recording/RecordingRepository.kt` — process-singleton `StateFlow`
  that the service writes and the ViewModel reads. The decoupling is
  the whole point.
- `recording/RunRecordingService.kt` — owns the GPS + HR streams, ticks
  the elapsed clock every 500ms, posts notification updates, holds the
  wake lock.
- `recording/CheckpointStore.kt` — DataStore snapshot of an in-progress
  run, written every 15s during recording. On next launch a surviving
  checkpoint is graded (below); one that still holds the only copy of a
  run raises the **"Recover unsaved run?"** prompt on the pre-run screen
  — accepting saves it as a finished run (queued for upload), discarding
  clears it. **Discard is behind a two-press confirm** (`ui/ConfirmGuard.kt`,
  decisions § 1206): the first press arms and relabels the chip, names what
  is at stake, and lapses after `CONFIRM_WINDOW_MS`; only a second press
  inside that window calls `discardCheckpoint`. The checkpoint is the run's
  only durable record while the queue does not hold it, and since § 1154
  Discard is the only enabled control on the screen whenever the queue is
  unreadable. This is what saves a run when the process is killed
  mid-recording. **The service never clears it**: stopping publishes
  `Finished` and tears the service down, and the checkpoint is cleared by
  `RunViewModel.handleFinishedRun` *after* `LocalRunStore` has accepted
  the run. Clearing it in the service ran concurrently with that write,
  right as the process left foreground-service state, so a kill in the
  window lost both records of the run.
- `recording/CheckpointRecovery.kt` — grades a surviving checkpoint
  before it is offered (`recoveryActionFor`), because `saveRun` upserts
  on the run id and re-uploads to the same Storage key: recovering a run
  the app already captured **overwrites** it rather than adding one. A
  run already in `LocalRunStore`, or one whose track file `pushRun` has
  deleted after a successful upload, is discarded silently; a checkpoint
  belonging to a live recording is left untouched (clearing it would
  disarm an in-progress run's safety net). The grade is re-taken when
  the runner accepts, since the cold-start drain can upload the run
  while the prompt is on screen. `sealTrackFileOrNull` closes an
  unterminated JSON array but returns null for a *missing* file rather
  than stubbing `[]` — publishing an empty track would blank the
  finished run's Storage object. See `decisions.md § 590`.
- `system/BatteryOptimization.kt` — checks
  `PowerManager.isIgnoringBatteryOptimizations` at launch and on each
  `onResume`. If we're not whitelisted, the pre-run screen surfaces a
  **"Fix battery saver"** chip that opens the system whitelist prompt.
  Without this, Android throttles the foreground service after ~10
  minutes — fatal for long runs. **Samsung One UI Watch (persona #35):**
  `ACTION_REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` *resolves* on Galaxy
  watches but is a no-op (the toggle lives in the paired Galaxy Wearable
  app). `system/BatteryGuidance.kt` (pure, `batteryFixStrategy(Build.MANUFACTURER)`)
  detects Samsung; `requestExemption` then returns
  `PromptResult.ManualGuidanceRecommended` instead of launching the dead
  intent, and the `BatteryInstructions` card leads with the Galaxy
  Wearable manual steps and hides the no-op "Try auto-open" chip. Pure
  strategy is unit-tested in `system/BatteryGuidanceTest.kt`.
- `system/NetworkWatcher.kt` — `ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback`
  flow. The ViewModel collects it; offline → online transitions fire
  `drainQueue` automatically so a run recorded out of range uploads as
  soon as connectivity returns.
- `awaitAuth()` in `RunViewModel.drainQueue` — waits up to 3s for the
  cached-session restore to land before bailing with "not
  authenticated". Kills the cold-start race that previously surfaced a
  spurious sync error after a quick start/stop.

### Ultra-length runs (10+ hours)

The recording loop was engineered for marathon scale (4–6 h); these
pieces extend that to all-day efforts without drifting into O(n) memory
or hammering the NotificationManager:

- `recording/TrackWriter.kt` streams GPS points to a JSON array on disk
  (`filesDir/tracks/{runId}.json`, resolved by `recording/TrackStorage.kt`)
  with a flush every 32 points. The in-memory point list is gone —
  `RecordingRepository.Metrics` carries only `trackPointCount` +
  `latestPoint` + `trackFilePath`. **`filesDir`, not `cacheDir`**: until the
  run has uploaded that file is the only copy of the trace, and the platform
  reclaims the cache dir under storage pressure without asking.
  `TrackStorage` also owns the cache→files migration for an install that
  already had runs queued, and the orphan sweep that replaces the platform's
  own reclamation — `RunViewModel.reconcileTrackStorage` runs both once per
  process, under the drain mutex, keeping the queue and the pending crash
  checkpoint and the live recording.
- Rolling HR. `RunRecordingService` tracks `bpmSum: Long` + `bpmCount:
  Long` instead of a list; avg is O(1) regardless of sample count.
  `Checkpoint` carries the same rolling pair, so recovery works without
  replaying 36,000 samples.
- Notification refresh is throttled to every 10 tickerJob iterations (~5s).
  The UI still gets its 500ms elapsed tick, but NotificationManager only
  sees a fraction of the churn.
- `SupabaseClient.saveRun` takes a `File?` and gzips disk-to-disk into a
  sibling temp file before uploading — peak memory is one 8 KiB buffer. A
  null means the payload is genuinely gone (purged out of the pre-migration
  cache dir), and the row is posted with a null `track_url` — the same shape
  an indoor recording takes — rather than the run sticking in the queue
  promising a sync that can never happen. `drainQueue` deletes the track file
  only **after** the queue entry is removed, so a missing file always means
  the track was never uploaded and the null cannot erase one already in
  Storage.
- `system/BatteryStatus.kt` reads `BATTERY_PROPERTY_CAPACITY` and the
  pre-run screen surfaces a warning below 40%. A 10-hour run on a half-
  charged watch is the single most common way to lose an ultra attempt.

Permissions added in the manifest: `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`,
`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION`, `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`,
`REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS`.

**Declaring a permission is half of it.** A runtime permission also has to be
asked for, and the only place this app asks is `permissionLauncher.launch(...)`
in `ui/RunWatchApp.kt`. `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` was declared and never requested,
so on API 33+ the ongoing-activity notification never reached the shade
(`decisions.md § 881`). `ManifestPermissionCoverageTest` derives the obligation
from the manifest: every declared permission is requested, install-time, or a
registered exemption with its reason. `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` is the only
exemption left — the platform grants it alongside the fine one.
`BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND` used to be the second, and was removed rather than
wired: it gates `PassiveMonitoringClient`, and this app reads heart rate through
`MeasureClient`, whose background access is documented as no
(`decisions.md § 1015`).

**Declaring a foreground-service TYPE is half of it too, and the halves live in
different files.** The manifest's `foregroundServiceType="location|health"` and
the mask passed to `startForeground` are two separate declarations of the same
fact; from API 34 it is the runtime mask the platform reads when deciding
whether the service may keep using a while-in-use permission. The service
declared both types and started with one for as long as the declaration existed
(`decisions.md § 1016`). `foregroundServiceTypeMask` computes it now — location
unconditionally, health on API 34+ once `BODY_SENSORS` or `ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION`
is granted, which is the platform's own prerequisite for that type — and the
guard derives the obligation from the manifest so a third type needs no new
test.

**A sensor that fails must cost that sensor.** All three device streams the
recording service collects carry a `.catch`, and `HeartRateMonitor` closes its
flow on both the synchronous throw and the `onRegistrationFailed` callback. A
`SupervisorJob` does not stop an unhandled exception in a `launch` from reaching
the process, so before this a declined `BODY_SENSORS` ended the whole recording
(`decisions.md § 1017`). `SensorStreamResilienceTest` derives the rule from the
source: every `<x>.stream()` in the service is followed by `.catch`.

**A denied permission dialog reports what it cost.** `permissionOutcome` grades
the launcher's result map into `canStart` plus the ordered list of losses, and
`PermissionNotice` renders one sentence each plus the routes back. An absent key
is not a denial — `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` is only requested from API 33
(`decisions.md § 1018`).

## What's still deferred

- **Ambient-mode rendering.** The recording continues in the foreground
  service when the watch dims — it will not be killed — but the Compose
  UI doesn't yet have a low-color "ambient" branch. Wire
  `AmbientLifecycleObserver` + a dimmed Compose render path. (Glanceable
  watch face complication is a separate, larger item.)
- **Pre-fetching tiles for a route on selection.** Tile rendering is opportunistic — tiles fetch on-demand as they enter the viewport. A network drop mid-run leaves new viewport areas un-tiled (polyline + midnight background still render). Pre-downloading the bounding-box tiles on route selection (or run start) would make the map robust against cellular drops, at the cost of an upfront fetch + a couple of MB of disk per route.
- **Google Sign-In on the watch** (today only email/password direct
  sign-in works; for Google use the phone app + Data Layer handoff, or
  build out `RemoteActivityHelper`).
- **BLE chest-strap HR on the watch (standalone).** The watch records
  optical HR via Health Services `MeasureClient` only. Pairing an
  external BLE chest strap directly to the watch (its own GATT client +
  scan/pair UI + `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`/`BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` runtime perms) is
  deferred — a sizeable feature for a minority of watch-standalone
  users, and the phone already owns BLE strap pairing
  (`apps/mobile_android/lib/ble_heart_rate.dart`). Persona samsung #33
  flipped the optical-HR default on; the BLE-on-wrist half stays out of
  scope until there's demand.
- **Per-user binding of the upload queue (vs. clear-on-sign-out).**
  `tearDownSession` currently *wipes* the upload queue on sign-out
  (fail-closed, so user A's queued runs can't upload under user B — see
  `LocalRunStore.clear` and the "Sign-out lifecycle" note above). The
  cost is that a run recorded offline and not yet synced is dropped on a
  deliberate sign-out. The more data-preserving design — stamp each
  `QueuedRun` with the owning `user_id` at save time, have `drainQueue`
  upload only runs matching the current session, and *keep* (not clear)
  the queue across sign-out — is deferred. It needs a `userId` field on
  `QueuedRun` (forward/back-compat via a kotlinx-serialization default)
  plus a drain-time filter. Until then, clear-on-sign-out is the
  intended, documented behaviour, not an oversight.
- **End-to-end soak test on a real device.** All of the above ships in
  this session as compiles-cleanly code; verifying it actually
  records 60+ minutes without dropping samples requires putting it on a
  watch and going for a real run.

## Active-run tile

`tiles/ActiveRunTileService.kt` is a `TileService` (Wear Tiles + ProtoLayout) that renders a glanceable summary of the live run on the watch face's tile carousel. Two states:

- **Idle** — single "Tap to start" prompt that launches `MainActivity` (deliberate: a one-tap "this starts a run NOW" tile would be a foot-gun for a casual swipe).
- **Active** (Recording or Paused) — three-line layout: status pip ("RUNNING" / "PAUSED"), elapsed time as the headline (`mm:ss` under an hour, `h:mm:ss` over), and a stats row "5.12 km · 5:30/km".

Pure formatters (`formatElapsed`, `formatStatRow`, `formatPaceSecPerKm`) are the only testable surface — the layouts themselves can't be unit-tested without Robolectric. 7 tests in `test/.../tiles/ActiveRunTileFormattersTest.kt` cover the boundary cases (zero-elapsed, sub-/over-hour crossover, negative-clamp, distance decimals at the 10 km cutoff, null/non-finite/non-positive pace).

Updates flow from `RunRecordingService`: every stage transition (`startRecording`, `pauseRecording`, `resumeRecording`, `stopRecording`) calls `ActiveRunTileService.requestUpdate(this)`. The platform debounces multiple rapid calls; we deliberately don't push per-second ticks because Wear OS throttles tile refreshes. The `freshnessIntervalMillis = 30_000L` on the active-state Tile lets the platform re-bind every 30 s when the user swipes to it mid-run, which catches up the elapsed display without us needing per-tick wake-ups. The wiring guard in `RouteMiniMapWiringTest` pins ≥4 `requestUpdate` call sites in `RunRecordingService`.

Manifest: `<service android:name=".tiles.ActiveRunTileService">` with `permission="com.google.android.wearable.permission.BIND_TILE_PROVIDER"` (only the Wear OS Tiles host can bind; `exported=true` is required because the host is a separate process). Preview drawable `res/drawable/tile_active_run_preview.xml` is what the watch face's tile picker shows when the user adds the tile; the live tile re-renders dynamically at request time. `res/values/strings.xml`'s `tile_active_run_label` is the picker chip text.

## Recording UX — what's shipped on the Running screen

What the UI exposes during a recording, for quick reference when reading
`ui/RunWatchApp.kt`:

**Post-run Discard is a two-press confirm, like the recovery prompt's.**
`PostRunScreen`'s bottom-end `×` renders only on the `!synced` branch, and
`RunViewModel.discard` is `store.remove(id)` — the queue is the only place
that run exists. The first tap arms; the whole bottom cluster is then replaced
by a labelled `Discard?` chip with "Not saved anywhere else" above it, and only
a tap on THAT chip calls `onDiscard`. The arm lapses after `CONFIRM_WINDOW_MS`
and a sync that lands while armed retires it. The confirm sits at bottom-CENTRE
rather than in the corner the arming tap landed in, so a double tap cannot
reach it. Pinned by `PostRunDiscardConfirmTest`; decisions § 1253.

**Post-run calories (persona samsung #34).** `PostRunScreen` shows a
`kcal` figure computed by `recording/RunCalories.kt` — the same
1 kcal/kg/km activity ladder as `apps/web/src/lib/calories.ts`, reading
`body_weight_kg` from the prefs bag (now on `UniversalSettings`, default
70 kg). It does NOT apply the female calibration the phone/web cell uses,
because the watch reads `user_settings.prefs` only, not the
`user_profiles.gender` column — the run-detail pages recompute with
gender once synced, so the only place the watch figure is final is its
own summary. Pinned by `RunCaloriesTest`. See decisions.md § 77.

**Rotary input (bezel / crown).** The genuinely scrollable list screens —
`BatteryInstructions` and the route picker — attach
`Modifier.rotaryScrollable(RotaryScrollableDefaults.behavior(scrollableState
= listState), focusRequester)` and request focus on appearance, so a
Galaxy Watch physical bezel or a Pixel Watch crown scrolls them (persona
samsung #32). The pre-run screen is deliberately NOT a scrolling column —
it's a region-anchored `Box` so overflow in one region can't push the
Start button off-frame — and the sign-in screen is excluded because its
`FocusRequester` belongs to the text inputs (auto-focusing the list would
steal focus from typing). `RotaryScrollWiringTest` pins the call sites.

- **Pre-run activity picker.** `CompactChip` on `PreRunScreen` cycles
  `run → walk → hike → cycle`; the choice flows through to
  `metadata.activity_type` on save.
- **3-second start countdown.** Between permission grant and
  `vm.start()`, a full-screen `CountdownOverlay` shows `3 → 2 → 1`
  (tap anywhere to cancel). UI-only — the recording service isn't live
  during the countdown.
- **Pause / resume.** `||` button toggles to `Go`; stage flips
  `Running ↔ Paused`. The foreground service owns the actual pause state
  via `RunRecordingService.pause / resume`.
- **Lap button.** `vm.markLap()` → service appends to the laps list;
  `FinishedSummary.laps` powers the splits table on `PostRunScreen`
  and writes `metadata.laps` on sync.
- **Hold-to-stop.** `HoldToStopButton` requires an 800 ms press before
  `vm.stop()` fires; a circular progress ring fills during the hold,
  releasing early cancels. Stops a single accidental tap from ending a
  long run.
- **Haptic confirmations.** Pause / Resume / Lap buttons fire
  `LocalHapticFeedback.performHapticFeedback(HapticFeedbackType.LongPress)`
  on tap — the runner feels a confirmation pulse on every control
  action, not just the countdown-less Start.
- **GPS self-heal retry.** `RunRecordingService.gpsRetryJob` mirrors
  the `_startGpsRetryLoop` shape from
  `packages/run_recorder/lib/src/run_recorder.dart`: a 10 s poll that
  re-subscribes whenever the subscription is dead. Primary trigger is
  `gpsJob?.isActive != true` (same as Android's `_positionSub == null`);
  secondary Wear-only trigger is "stream silent for >30 s mid-run",
  added because `FusedLocationProviderClient` can keep a callback
  registered while silently emitting nothing — a failure mode
  Geolocator surfaces as a stream error. Initial no-fix
  (`lastPointAtMs == 0L`) is explicitly not a stall; that's indoor mode.
- **Indoor / no-GPS mode.** The elapsed clock ticks regardless of GPS;
  distance stays 0 until the first fix lands. `TrackWriter.close()`
  produces a valid empty `[]` track, so the upload and downstream run
  detail render without special-casing. The RunningScreen banner reads
  "No GPS — time only" when no fix has landed yet, and "GPS lost"
  after a mid-run drop, so the runner can tell the two apart.
- **Route overlay (no map).** Pre-run Route chip → `Stage.RoutePicker`
  (backed by `LocalRouteStore` + `SupabaseClient.fetchRoutes`).
  The fetch is filtered server-side to **starred routes only**
  (`is_starred=eq.true&order=updated_at.desc&limit=30`) so a runner
  with 200 saved routes doesn't have to scroll a 1.4-inch screen.
  When the starred query returns empty (first-launch / un-curated
  user) `fetchRoutes` falls back to the 10 most-recently-updated
  owned routes so the picker isn't empty before the runner has
  starred anything. Starring is done from web (`/routes` cards +
  `/routes/[id]` header) or mobile (`routes_screen.dart` trailing
  star, `route_detail_screen` AppBar star) — the watch is read-only
  on this flag. See `docs/architecture/decisions.md § 44`.
  `RoutesBridge.kt` adds a second inbound source: the paired phone's
  `WearRoutesBridge` pushes the user's starred subset to
  `/saved_routes` on the Wearable Data Layer whenever the phone's
  `LocalRouteStore` changes. `RunViewModel.observeRoutesBridge()`
  overwrites the watch's DataStore cache + live picker on every
  push — run-start works without watch connectivity as long as the
  phone has wifi/LTE. Supabase `fetchRoutes` stays the canonical
  refresh when the watch *does* have its own network. See
  `docs/architecture/decisions.md § 64`.
  Selected waypoints flow via `ACTION_START` extras into
  `RunRecordingService.parseRouteWaypoints`, which calls
  `RouteMath.offRouteDistanceM` + `routeRemainingM` per GPS sample.
  `RunningScreen` renders the "Off route · N m" banner (with hysteresis
  at 40 m / 20 m and a double-haptic on entry) and a "X.XX km to go"
  badge under the distance readout. `ui/RouteMiniMap.kt` draws the
  route polyline + a runner-position dot on a 56 dp canvas; the
  track-so-far is overlaid as a faded indigo polyline behind the
  route. The track is fed by a rolling buffer the recording service
  appends to per GPS sample; once it grows past 256 points
  `recording/TrackOverlayBuffer.halveIfOverflowing` halves it in
  place by keeping every other index — geometric (not FIFO) so the
  start of the run stays anchored on the polyline regardless of run
  length. Tile background is still deferred (see "What's still
  deferred" above).
- **TTS audio cues.** `recording/TtsAnnouncer.kt` wraps
  `android.speech.tts.TextToSpeech` with an async init + flush-queued
  speak. `RunRecordingService` announces "Run started" on begin,
  a split on each completed unit of the runner's `preferred_unit`
  ("1 kilometre. Pace 5 minutes 30 seconds per kilometre" / "1 mile.
  Pace 8 minutes 2 seconds per mile" — same phrasing as Android's
  `audio_cues.dart`), pace-drift nudges from `firePaceAlert`, and a
  finish summary in `stopRecording`. Both the cadence and the wording
  follow the unit: the trigger is `completedSplits(distance, unit)` and
  each phrase has a `_km` / `_mi` resource (`decisions.md § 467`). Gated
  on `BuildConfig.ENABLE_TTS` (defaults on; set `DISABLE_TTS=true` in
  `.env.local` to silence).
- **Target-pace picker + haptic pace alerts.** Pre-run **Pace** chip
  cycles `off / 4:00 / 4:30 / 5:00 / 5:30 / 6:00 / 6:30 / 7:00 /km` via
  `RunViewModel.cycleTargetPace`. `start()` passes the value through
  `EXTRA_TARGET_PACE_SEC_PER_KM`; the service compares live pace every
  GPS sample (after the 50 m stabilisation gate used for pace) and
  calls `firePaceAlert(tooSlow)` when drift > 30 s/km, rate-limited to
  one alert per 30 s. Haptic fires via `VibratorManager` — a
  `createWaveform(longArrayOf(0, 180, 180, 180), ...)` double pulse
  for "speed up", a `createOneShot(220, DEFAULT_AMPLITUDE)` single
  pulse for "slow down", paired with a TTS nudge. Matches the
  two-pulse vs single-pulse pattern on Android. `Vibrator.vibrate` is
  permission-gated, so the manifest's `VIBRATE` declaration is load-bearing:
  without it the call throws `SecurityException` on every watch and the
  alert silently degrades to TTS-only, which is indistinguishable at the
  call site from a watch with no vibrator (decisions § 1302 — it was in
  that state until 2026-09-06, pinned now by the used-to-declared half of
  `ManifestPermissionCoverageTest`).
- **Pedometer.** `Pedometer.kt` wraps `Sensor.TYPE_STEP_COUNTER` with a
  per-run baseline subtraction so the flow yields cumulative steps
  since recording started. `RunRecordingService` collects into
  `RecordingRepository.Metrics.steps`; `QueuedRun.steps` persists the
  final count; `pushRun` writes `run.metadata.steps` when non-zero. The
  15 s recovery `Checkpoint` snapshots `steps` (and the runner's
  `privacy_default`) alongside the rolling HR pair, so a
  crash-recovered run stamps the same `steps` + `isPublic` a normal
  stop would (#389) — `recoverCheckpoint` maps `Checkpoint.privacyDefault`
  through the shared `isPublicFromPrivacyDefault` helper.
  Requires `ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION` at runtime — requested alongside
  `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` + `BODY_SENSORS` by `permissionLauncher`.
  `RunningScreen` surfaces the live count as a `"N steps"` caption
  beneath `bpm`.

## Localization (i18n)

The app ships in seven locales (`en/de/fr/es/ja/pt-BR/pt-PT`) via **standard
Android string resources** — no custom framework, no in-app picker
(device-locale-follow is the platform norm on a tiny screen).

- **Resources**: default English in `res/values/strings.xml`; translations in
  `res/values-de/`, `-fr/`, `-es/`, `-ja/`, `res/values-b+pt+BR/` and
  `res/values-b+pt+PT/` (the BCP-47 `b+` qualifier both Portuguese variants
  need). Every user-facing literal in `ui/RunWatchApp.kt`,
  `recording/RunRecordingService.kt` (notification + ongoing-activity text),
  `tiles/ActiveRunTileService.kt`, and the `Token refresh failed` error in
  `RunViewModel` reads from resources. Compose uses `stringResource` /
  `pluralStringResource`; services/tiles use `context.getString(...)`.
- **Per-app language**: `res/xml/locales_config.xml` lists the seven and is
  referenced from `<application android:localeConfig=...>` so Android 13+
  surfaces a per-app language toggle in system settings.
- **Number formatting + distance unit**: `recording/UnitFormat.kt` is the
  single place both the decimal separator and the km↔mi choice are decided.
  `formatDistance(metres, unit, locale)` formats via `NumberFormat` keyed to
  `Locale.getDefault()` and divides by km or mile per the runner's
  `DistanceUnit`; `paceSecPerUnit` scales a sec/km pace to sec/mi. The unit
  pref (`preferred_unit`, `km`|`mi`) rides the universal-settings bag the same
  way `body_weight_kg` does — `SupabaseClient.parseUniversalSettings` →
  `RunViewModel.UiState.preferredUnit` → the consuming screens + the
  active-run tile (carried on `RecordingRepository.Metrics`, stamped at
  `startRecording`). The unit words ("km" / "mi") are locale-invariant and
  live in `R.string.distance_km` / `distance_mi` (+ `_to_go`, `pace_per_*`).
  Time digits (`mm:ss`, pace) are pinned to `Locale.ROOT`. The same file also
  decides the **split cadence** — `splitIntervalMetres` / `completedSplits` —
  so the spoken cue lands on the runner's own unit rather than on a hardcoded
  kilometre (`decisions.md § 467`).
- **TTS**: `recording/TtsAnnouncer.kt` sets the engine language to
  `Locale.getDefault()` (best-effort — falls back to the engine default voice
  if voice data is missing) and assembles spoken phrases from `tts_*` resources
  / the `tts_split_unit_km` / `tts_split_unit_mi` plurals. Same dialect as the
  mobile `apps/mobile_android/lib/l10n/app_*.arb` so a runner carrying both
  devices hears identical cues. Every unit-bearing phrase exists as a
  `_km` / `_mi` pair and the announcer picks by `DistanceUnit`; `TtsPhrases.kt`
  keeps only the pure numeric decomposition (`paceMinSec` / `paceMinSecFor`,
  `finishMinutes`, `finishDistanceSpoken` — the spoken distance uses a period
  decimal so no engine reads "comma").
- **Shared vocabularies are the phone's, verbatim.** The five `activity_*`
  labels are the same words `apps/mobile_android/lib/l10n/app_*.arb` and
  `apps/web/src/lib/i18n/locales/*.ts` use, not shorter ones chosen for the
  56 dp pre-run chip: that chip's label box is 32 dp, which the long words
  already overflow in every locale, so it ellipsises and the
  `contentDescription` carries the whole word (decisions § 713). There is no
  divergence left: `hike` read "Hike" here and "Trail run" there under a guard
  exemption until decisions § 1155 took the owner call and the wrist adopted
  the phone's word in all six locales that differed. The guard now compares
  the whole vocabulary with nothing exempt.
- **Tests**: `L10nResourceParityTest` (Wear-OS analogue of the mobile
  `l10n_parity_test`) asserts every `values-xx` declares exactly the default
  key set, no empty values, and matching format-arg sets.
  `ActivityTypeVocabularyTest` asserts the activity words equal the ARB's and
  the web catalogue's locale for locale with no exemptions,
  and pins the phone catalogues the wrist does not mirror —
  `unmirroredPhoneCatalogues` is `emptySet()` since the wrist gained European
  Portuguese, and it is checked in BOTH directions, so a phone locale with no
  `values-*` directory and a stale entry the wrist has caught up on each fail.
  `LocaleReachTest` + `WearLocalesTest` hold every site that DECLARES the
  locale set — `locales_config.xml`, the manifest's `localeConfig` reference,
  and both test-side lists — to the `values-*` directories on disk via
  `WearLocales`, so a new string set cannot ship unlisted or unchecked
  (decisions § 748). Note the test task takes `src/main/res` as an input only
  because `app/build.gradle.kts` says so; without that a resource-only change
  leaves `testDebugUnitTest` UP-TO-DATE.
  `UnitFormatTest` pins the locale decimal separator; `TtsLocaleWiringTest`
  pins the device-locale + resource-phrase wiring.
- **When you add a user-facing string**: add it to `values/strings.xml` AND
  every `values-xx` file (the parity test reads the directory, so it fails on
  whichever ones exist), keep format args (`%1$s` …) intact and in the right
  order, and escape apostrophes as `\'`.
- **When you add a LOCALE**: create `values-xx/strings.xml`, add the tag to
  `res/xml/locales_config.xml`, and pair the directory with its phone + web
  catalogue in `ActivityTypeVocabularyTest.localeCatalogues`. Nothing else
  needs touching — every other site derives. `LocaleReachTest` names whichever
  step you skipped.

## Testing convention

Pure-JVM JUnit tests in `app/src/test/kotlin/com/runapp/watchwear/`. Run with `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`. Current total: 717 tests across 70 files (measured 2026-09-03; the count is not gated and drifts fast). No Robolectric, no Compose UI test instrumentation — deliberate. The pattern when a load-bearing piece of logic is bound to an Android API (foreground service, OkHttp, Health Services, SensorEventListener, Compose):

1. **Extract the pure logic** into a file-level `internal fun` (or a `companion object` static when it must live on the host class). The Android-bound wrapper method delegates one-line to the helper.
2. **Test the helper** in isolation against a JVM target. No Robolectric runner, no `androidx.compose.ui.test.*`.
3. **For UI wiring** that can't be re-expressed as pure logic (callbacks wired through `@Composable` private functions), add a source-grep arch guard à la `ScreenWiringTest.kt` / `RouteMiniMapWiringTest.kt` — they catch refactors that silently drop callback bindings (e.g. removing `HoldToStopButton`, dropping `markLap`, unwiring the recovery prompt). Cheap, no infrastructure investment, surface-level only.

Examples of the extract-then-test pattern in this codebase:
- `DrainQueueLoop.kt` ← extracted from `RunViewModel.drainQueue` (sync orchestration)
- `PaceAlert.kt` ← extracted from `RunRecordingService.onGps` (rate-limited drift trigger)
- `GpsRetryDecision.kt` ← extracted from `RunRecordingService.gpsRetryJob` (self-heal decision)
- `RouteWaypointsParser.kt` ← extracted from `RunRecordingService.parseRouteWaypoints` (untrusted Intent input)
- `TtsPhrases.kt` ← extracted from `TtsAnnouncer` (cross-platform voice-cue dialect)
- `SupabaseUrlBuilders.kt` ← extracted from `SupabaseClient` (URLs + bodies)
- `PedometerMath.kt` ← extracted from `Pedometer.stream` (baseline subtraction)
- `buildFinishedLapsList` ← extracted as file-level `internal fun` in `RunViewModel.kt` (lap split / cumulative math)
- `buildSaveRunRowMap` + `encodeJsonMap` ← extracted as file-level `internal fun` in `SupabaseClient.kt`

When you ship a refactor that adds a meaningfully complex branch, follow the same shape — the surface area that needs Robolectric is uncovered by design.

The full file-by-file test coverage is documented in [../../docs/testing/testing.md § apps/watch_wear/.../*Test.kt](../../docs/testing/testing.md). Don't keep the count in sync by hand — the doc says "Counts here are point-in-time — they drift fast" and CI doesn't gate on the number.

## Before reporting a task done

- `./gradlew compileDebugKotlin` passes.
- `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` passes if you touched any of the extracted helpers or added a new one.
- If you touched the `runs` schema or added a table to `_kotlinTables`, re-ran `dart run scripts/gen_dart_models.dart` and committed the regenerated Kotlin file.
- Updated [../../docs/backend/metadata.md](../../docs/backend/metadata.md) if a new `metadata` key is written from this app.
- Ticked the corresponding Wear OS box in [../../docs/product/roadmap.md](../../docs/product/roadmap.md).
