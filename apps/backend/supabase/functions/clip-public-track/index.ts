//      private rows get null and we 404.
//   3. Download the gzipped track via the service-role client (the
//      anon Storage policy was just removed).
//   4. Merge the job_worker's smoothed-position sidecar onto the points
//      when it names this exact track (watch runs, recomputed runs).
//   5. If the caller is not the owner, route the points through
//      clip_track_for_user. Owners receive the unclipped track.
//   6. Return the points as JSON.
