/**
 * Current-calendar-week derivation for the dashboard "This Week" strip.
 *
 * Unlike the plan-detail CurrentWeekStrip (which anchors its 7-day window
 * to the plan's `start_date + week_index*7` so its count matches the week
 * card), this strip is the runner's REAL calendar week — the seven days of
 * the week that contains `now`, starting on the user's `week_start` pref —
 * with each day's logged-activity distance + count folded in.
 *
 * Pure: no Supabase, no DOM, no rune state — so it unit-tests under
 * `tsx --test`, and it is the web half of a registered parity pair with the
 * Dart twin `apps/mobile_android/lib/current_week.dart`. Keep the algorithm,
 * edge cases, outputs, and test counts in lockstep. (The WIDGET that renders
 * it is `apps/mobile_android/lib/widgets/current_week_strip.dart`, which is
 * not a twin of anything.)
