// Guardrail: the TS↔Dart parity-pair registry says the same thing in both
// places it is written down.
//
//   docs/architecture/parity_pairs.md — the "TS↔Dart parity helpers must stay
//     in lockstep" bullet, which is the human-facing list a session reads to
//     decide whether an edit it just made needs mirroring to the other
//     platform. It lived in the root CLAUDE.md until it reached 115 KB — about
//     29,000 tokens re-sent on every prompt of every session, to carry a
//     registry that only matters when a session touches one of the pairs. The
//     bullet moved verbatim; CLAUDE.md keeps the rule and points here, and
//     property 5 below is what keeps that pointer honest.
//   .claude/agents/engineering/shared-library-syncer.md — the "The pairs (canonical list)"
//     table, which is the list the shared-library-syncer AGENT works from.
//
// Why this exists: decisions.md § 604. The two had drifted 19 pairs apart —
// 15 registered in the prose and absent from the table, 4 the other way. The
// table is the operative half: the syncer is the only automated detector of
// parity divergence, and its own instructions tell it to stop rather than
// invent a claim about a pair the table does not list. So a pair missing from
// it is a pair whose divergence is never caught, silently, while CLAUDE.md
// reads as though it is covered. `roadbook` was in that state on the day a
// change altered it on web, on Dart and in the watch port at once.
//
// That is not a hypothetical failure mode for this repo: decisions.md § 305
// records two helpers whose doc comments claimed lockstep for a long time
// while they carried different algorithms and each suite pinned the opposite
// answer. Undetected divergence is the expensive kind.
//
// Four properties, all cheap:
//
//   1. Every pair named in the registry has a row in the syncer table.
//   2. Every row in the syncer table is named in the registry. The reverse
//      direction matters because the registry is what a session reads FIRST: a
//      pair missing from it reads as a single-platform helper, and the edit
//      never reaches the agent that would have caught the divergence.
//   3. Where the registry annotates the two file paths, they agree with the row.
//   4. Every path either registry names exists on disk. A rename that leaves
//      a registry pointing at nothing is the same defect one step later —
//      and it was already live: profile_query.ts's own header named a Dart
//      twin at a path that does not exist.
//   5. The root CLAUDE.md still points at the registry. Property 2 rests on a
//      session reaching the list at all, and the list is no longer in the file
//      every session is handed. A dropped link would leave every pair reading
//      as a single-platform helper with all four other properties green — the
//      §604 failure mode one level up, so it is checked rather than trusted.
//
// Check 4 overlaps deliberately with `lib_structure_guards.test.ts`, which
// already asserts the table's web `.ts` paths exist. That one lives in the web
// unit suite, which is gated on a non-docs diff — so it is skipped by exactly
// the markdown-only edit that breaks a path. Keeping the check here as well
// covers the Dart and mirror-test paths it never read, and covers all of them
// on a docs PR.
//
// The vacuous-pass case is checked throughout: each parser fails loudly if its
// anchor text is gone or it matched nothing, rather than reporting two empty
// sets as agreement. A guard that inspects nothing enforces nothing. The
// bidirectionality of check 1+2 is itself an anti-vacuity property — a reworded
// entry drops out of one set and is immediately reported as missing from it,
// so a parser that quietly stops understanding the prose cannot pass.
//
// Run: `node scripts/check_parity_pair_registry.mjs`

//      `CI gate` aggregator's `needs:` list.
