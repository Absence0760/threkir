-- Pins migration 20270408_001 (version-controlled public-schema grant matrix).
--
-- Prod onboarding broke on 2026-07-13 with `42501 permission denied for
-- table user_profiles` / `user_settings` because the `authenticated` role
-- had lost base table privileges that lived only in Supabase's implicit
-- default privileges, never a migration. This test fails CI if that class
-- of gap returns.
--
--   1. Catch-all: every public base table EXCEPT the deliberately
--      service_role-only ones must be readable by `authenticated` via a
--      table-level or column-level SELECT. A table shipped without a
--      SELECT grant (the user_settings-shaped regression) fails HERE.
--   2. Functional probes on the exact incident columns + the DML surface
--      onboarding needs.
--   3. The column-SELECT lockdown on user_profiles is preserved (no
--      table-level SELECT leaked back in).
--   4. The same for the two payment tables, which this migration granted a
--      table-level SELECT while its own header claimed it "never grants
--      table-level SELECT on a column-locked table". It was generated from
--      the fully-migrated schema, and 20261229_001 / 20270213_001 had written
--      their lockdowns as COLUMN-level revokes — a no-op under a table-level
--      grant, leaving no column ACL for the generator to see. 20270621_001
--      re-cut both to the prescribed shape; these pin that the matrix does not
--      widen them back, and that the columns the payout UI reads survived.

-- (1) Catch-all — readability. Only app_quota, deletion_audit_log,
-- data_export_jobs, payment_refunds and apple_sign_in_tokens are intentionally service_role-only (no
-- anon/authenticated grant at all). data_export_jobs (20270603_001) holds the
-- state of an Art 20 export request; the row is useless to a client without a
-- signed URL, which only the service role can mint, so the whole read goes
-- through the Go worker's JWT-authed status endpoint and the table needs no
-- client grant. payment_refunds (20270630000001) is one row per Stripe Refund
-- on either money ledger: the amounts it holds reach a donor through
-- fundraiser_feed's net figure and an operator through the service role, and
-- there is no client surface that reads a refund row itself — so it takes the
-- 20270621_001 lockdown at TABLE level rather than re-granting a column set
-- nothing would call. apple_sign_in_tokens (20270714000001) is a Vault
-- reference to a live Sign in with Apple refresh token: only
-- apple-token-exchange writes it and only delete-account reads it, both as
-- the service role, so no client role may hold any grant on it.
