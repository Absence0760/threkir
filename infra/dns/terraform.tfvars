#   - Resend (OUTBOUND app mail) lives on the `send.` subdomain.
#   - Migadu (INBOUND + human @threkir.com mailboxes) lives on the apex.
# DMARC is domain-wide — one `_dmarc` record governs both; do not add a
# second. The `p=none;` below stays until both Resend and Migadu have been
# authenticating for 48h+, then it can tighten to `p=quarantine;`.
#
# Migadu MX/SPF/DKIM-CNAME/autoconfig targets are fixed for all Migadu
# domains; only `migadu_verify` is account-specific — paste the token from
# admin.migadu.com → Domains → threkir.com before applying.

  # CloudFront. BIMI is a display-only hint — publishing it is harmless
  # even when nothing renders it yet.
  #
  # TWO fail-closed prerequisites, in this order, before a logo actually
  # shows:
  #   1. DMARC MUST be at enforcement (p=quarantine or p=reject, and not
  #      sp=none). The `dmarc` record above is still `p=none`, so NO
  #      mailbox provider will honour this BIMI record yet — tightening
  #      DMARC (see the p=none note above) is the gating step, and carries
  #      its own deliverability risk (raise it only after alignment has
  #      been passing).
  #   2. Gmail (and other VMC-requiring inboxes) additionally need a paid
  #      Verified Mark Certificate. Leave `a=` UNSET until the VMC PEM is
  #      purchased and hosted — then append it to the record value:
  #        "v=BIMI1; l=https://threkir.com/bimi-logo.svg; a=https://threkir.com/bimi-vmc.pem;"
  #      With `a=` unset the logo still shows in clients that don't demand
  #      a VMC; Gmail lights up only once `a=` is filled (fail-closed).

  # above.) Keep this in sync with whichever relay `SMTP_HOST` points at.
