// Guardrail: no Edge Function module sits outside the `deno check` lane.
//
// The Supabase Edge Functions are a Deno program, not a tsc one — their
// modules import over `https:` specifiers tsc's resolver cannot follow — so
// `scripts/tsconfig_coverage.test.mjs` exempts the tree and points here
// instead. What covers it is the `Edge Function typecheck` step of the
// `edge-functions` job, added in decisions § 762 after a `deno check` over the
// tree reported 81 errors that no workflow had ever run.
//
// The lane can only stay complete if what it checks is DERIVED. Its
// predecessor in the same job was written as three hardcoded test paths and
// silently missed every `*.test.ts` added afterwards; that is the failure this
// exists to make impossible. So rather than restate the file set, this guard
// reads the workflow, lifts the step's own `files=$(…)` expression out of it,
// runs THAT, and compares the result with every Deno-compilable source file
// under the tree. The two cannot disagree, because there is only one of them.
//
// Run: `node --test scripts/edge_functions_typecheck_coverage.test.mjs`
// CI:  the `workflow-lint` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml.
