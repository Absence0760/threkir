/// Chunked (tus) Storage upload sink for the Art 20 export.
///
/// The export used to assemble the whole archive as one in-memory Blob
/// and hand it to `storage.upload()`. That is what forced the two caps
/// the manifest had to apologise for — 5000 runs and 50,000 rows per
/// section — because a deep history's tracks alone run to hundreds of
/// megabytes and the function has a few hundred available. A cap that
/// exists to keep an allocation alive is not a data-minimisation
/// decision; it is a subject not receiving their data.
///
/// Supabase Storage speaks tus 1.0 at `/storage/v1/upload/resumable`,
/// so the archive can be pushed as it is produced and only one chunk is
/// ever resident. Every non-final chunk must be exactly 6 MiB — that is
/// the server's requirement, not a tunable — so this sink buffers to
/// that boundary and flushes.
///
/// Two properties matter more than throughput:
///
///   - **Fail closed.** tus materialises the object only once the
///     declared length has been received. A creation, PATCH or offset
///     mismatch throws, and the caller turns that into a 500 with no
///     artifact at all — so a run that died half-way can never present
///     a truncated archive as a complete one. That is the whole reason
///     the total length is declared on the FINAL chunk rather than
///     guessed up front.
///   - **The total length is not knowable up front.** A zip's size is
///     whatever the deflate stream turns out to be, so creation uses
///     tus's `creation-defer-length` and the last PATCH declares the
///     total. An archive that fits in a single chunk skips the deferral
///     entirely (the length IS known by then), which keeps the common
///     case on the plainest path the server offers.
