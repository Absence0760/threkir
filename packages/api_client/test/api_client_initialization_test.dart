/// Supabase init via `.catchError` and then constructed an
/// `ApiClient()` regardless. The first method call (e.g. `saveRoute`)
/// blew up deep inside the SDK with a stack trace the user couldn't

/// `if (hasSupabase && ApiClient.isInitialized)` gate keeps `api`
/// null, so the rest of the app falls through to the existing
