/**
 * Shared contract for the WCAG 1.4.10 reflow specs. Extracted so the static
 * sweep (cross-cutting/reflow-narrow-viewport.spec.ts) and the seeded-dynamic
 * sweep (cross-cutting/reflow-seeded-routes.spec.ts) cannot drift into two
 * different definitions of "conforms".
 *
 * The assertion is the derivation, never a pixel (§ 500): a page conforms when
 * `documentElement.scrollWidth` is no wider than its `clientWidth`. Content
 * that genuinely cannot reflow — a data table, a segmented control, a course
 * editor's set grid — is allowed to scroll *inside its own* `overflow-x: auto`
 * box, which is exactly what that comparison tolerates and a hard px bound
 * would not.
 *
 * The 300 px row is headroom, not a stricter reading of the criterion. A page
 * whose narrowest fit is 318 px passes at 320 on one renderer and fails on
 * another: CI's Linux font stack measured these routes 12-20 px wider than a
 * macOS run, which is how `/routes` (318 px narrowest fit locally) passed
 * locally and failed CI at 330 (§ 535's amendment). Asserting one viewport
 * below the requirement converts that invisible 2 px into a visible 20 px, and
 * it is the same derivation — no absolute width is asserted anywhere.
