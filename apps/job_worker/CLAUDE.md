# job_worker — AI session notes

Generic Go service that drains the `jobs` queue (migration
`20260609_001_run_match_pipeline.sql`). Kinds today: `map_match`
(server-side OSRM map matching), `token_refresh` (Strava OAuth
rotation, replaces the `refresh-tokens` Edge Function), `strava_event`
(per-activity ingest enqueued by the `/v1/strava/webhook` endpoint,
replaces the `strava-webhook` Edge Function), `photo_process` (EXIF
strip + 512w thumbnail on uploaded run photos), `route_photo_process`
(the `route_photos` sibling of `photo_process` — same download → strip →
thumbnail → PATCH against the `route-photos` bucket + `route_photos` table,
migration `20270224_001`), `club_photo_process` (the `club_photos`
sibling of `photo_process` — same download → strip → 512w thumbnail →
PATCH against the `club-photos` bucket + `club_photos` table, migration
`20270301_001`), `notification_email` (the email
delivery channel for the notifications inbox + event-day reminders —
roadmap Phase 4b, `decisions.md § 117`), `lifecycle_email`
(transactional/relationship mail with no notifications row — the welcome
on signup today, weekly digest / re-engagement later; keyed by a template
name, `decisions.md § 119`), `safety_email` (safety-contact confirm +
finish alerts, `decisions.md § 131`), and `web_push` (the browser Web Push
delivery channel — sibling of `notification_email` over the same
notifications rows; encrypted RFC 8291 messages signed with a VAPID key,
`decisions.md § 133` / migration `20261219_001`). Data-export will land as an
additional kind in `internal/worker.go`'s dispatch when that Edge
Function moves per
[`../../docs/product/roadmap.md`](../../docs/product/roadmap.md) §214.

## Scope — read before writing code

**Two concerns share this binary:**

1. **Job-queue drain** — claims `jobs` rows, runs the matcher, writes
   `run_matched_tracks`. This is the original concern; the worker is
   the *only* place writes to those tables originate. Both are
   RLS-locked and the SECURITY DEFINER functions
   (`claim_next_job`, `finish_job`, `defer_job`) are revoked from
   PUBLIC and granted only to `service_role`. The worker auths with
   the service role key.
2. **Live spectator hub** — in-process pub/sub keyed by `run_id`. The
   mobile recorder POSTs ping bodies to `POST /v1/live/{run_id}/push`;
   spectators stream pings over `GET /v1/live/{run_id}/subscribe`
   (WebSocket) or fetch the last-known position via
   `GET /v1/live/{run_id}/snapshot`. Implementation lives in
   `internal/livehub/`. Today the buffer is an in-process map keyed
   by run_id; the roadmap calls for Upstash Redis pub/sub with a 24h
   TTL — the swap is mechanical because the Hub's Publish + Subscribe
   surface is the only touchpoint. **Auth** is enforced by
   `livehub.JWTAuthorizer` over `internal/supajwt`, which verifies
   asymmetric tokens (ES256/RS256) against the JWKS derived from
   `SUPABASE_URL` and, additionally, HS256 over `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`
   when that legacy shared secret is set (decisions §276): pushes are
   owner-only (no anon path even on public runs); subscribes/snapshots
   are anon for `is_public=true` runs and owner-only otherwise;
   missing or expired tokens 403; unknown run ids 403; tokens signed
   with the wrong key 403. The `(user_id, is_public)` lookup is cached
   per-room via `Hub.LoadRunMeta` so a hot publisher's per-5s push is
   one map hit after warm-up. Permissive (no-auth) mode is never
   inferred from missing config — it takes an explicit
   `LIVEHUB_DISABLE_AUTH=1` (local/CI only, refused when
   `LIVEHUB_REQUIRE_AUTH=1`). **Privacy zones** are
   enforced server-side: `Server.shouldDrop` runs
   `IsInAnyZone(p.lat, p.lng, room.zones)` on every `/push`. Zones
   are fetched once per room via `SupabaseZoneFetcher` and cached
   on the room until GC. **Fail-closed** on fetch errors — a
   Supabase outage drops the ping rather than risk leaking a home
   coordinate. Mirrors the `live_run_pings_drop_in_zone` BEFORE-INSERT
   trigger on the Supabase Realtime path so both transports honour
   the same contract.

**Build here:**

- New `Matcher` implementations — see the interface in
  [`internal/matcher.go`](internal/matcher.go). `PassthroughMatcher`
  is the smoke-test default; `OSRMMatcher` (in
  [`internal/matcher_osrm.go`](internal/matcher_osrm.go)) is the
  first real engine and is selected in `main.go` when `OSRM_URL` is
  set. Valhalla / GraphHopper would each be a sibling file plus
  another env-driven branch.
- Additional job kinds — extend the switch in `Worker.dispatch`,
  extend the CHECK allowlist on `jobs.kind` (migration
  `20260822_001_jobs_kind_allowlist.sql` is the precedent), and
  extend the pgtap suite at
  `apps/backend/supabase/tests/jobs_kind_allowlist_test.sql`. The
  three steps must land together — the DB rejects an unknown kind
  at INSERT (23514) rather than at the worker's dispatch, so
  shipping a new kind without all three slips it through silently.
  Two of the three are now enforced rather than remembered:
  `internal/worker_dispatch_coverage_test.go` replays the migrations
  for the final `jobs_kind_chk` and fails a `case` the CHECK forbids
  (dead code reading as a shipped feature) as well as an admitted
  kind with no `case` (every enqueued row claimed, failed as unknown
  and retried to exhaustion). So the migration and the switch line
  are ONE commit — either alone is red, in opposite directions
  (measured both ways for `export_blob_reap`, decisions § 1144).
  The pgtap file is still on you.
  `token_refresh` (sweeps expiring Strava integrations + rotates via
  `/oauth/token`) is in `handler_token_refresh.go` and is the worked
  example for "port a scheduled Edge Function into the queue".
- **`export_blob_reap` is written and not yet routable.**
  `handler_export_blob_reap.go` + its tests are on `main`; the
  `Worker.dispatch` case is deliberately absent because
  `internal/worker_dispatch_coverage_test.go` fails a `case` for a kind
  `jobs_kind_chk` forbids, and the CHECK is a migration. Adding the
  migration, the pgtap case and the one-line `case "export_blob_reap":
  return w.handleExportBlobReap(ctx, job)` is one commit; the exact SQL
  is in `docs/product/followups.md`. Until then nothing enqueues it and
  the handler runs only under its own tests. See `decisions.md § 1112`.
  `notification_email` (`handler_notification_email.go` +
  `mailer.go`) is the worked example for "trigger-enqueued fan-out with
  an external transport": the notifications AFTER-INSERT trigger queues
  one job per recipient, the handler checks the
  `user_settings.prefs.email_notifications` preference, resolves the
  address via the GoTrue admin API, and sends over SMTP. Gated on
  `SMTP_HOST` — unset → jobs finish done but leave rows unstamped so a
  later email-enabled deploy can still send. Local dev points at the
  Supabase Mailpit catcher.
  `lifecycle_email` (`handler_lifecycle_email.go`) is the worked example
  for "transactional mail with no notifications row": a `{user_id,
  template}` payload, a template renderer in `mailer.go`, and a
  `lifecycle_email_log (user_id, template)` send-once guard. The welcome
  is trigger-enqueued on signup (`user_profiles` AFTER INSERT); the Pro
  receipt (`pro_welcome`) + payment-failed dunning (`payment_failed`) are
  trigger-enqueued on `user_profiles` AFTER UPDATE of the subscription
  columns (`decisions.md § 121`) and are RECURRING — they skip the
  once-per-user log (`oncePerUserTemplates` gates it to `welcome`). The
  account-deletion receipt (`account_deleted`, decisions §121) reuses this kind
  but is the one INLINE-ADDRESS template (`inlineAddressTemplates`): its payload
  carries `{email, locale}` and no `user_id` (the user is gone by send time),
  so `handleLifecycleEmail` routes it to `handleAccountDeletionReceipt`, which
  resolves the address from the payload (not GoTrue) and dedups on a hash
  of the address via the non-cascading `account_deletion_receipts` table
  (not `lifecycle_email_log`, which cascades away with the user). **That hash
  is keyed when `DELETION_AUDIT_KEY` is set on THIS process** — HMAC-SHA256 over
  a domain-separated address — and the legacy bare SHA-256 when it is not: an
  address is a guessable input, so only the keyed form stops a holder of a
  candidate address recomputing the digest and asking the table whether that
  person deleted their account (`decisions § 1551`, `§ 1600`). It is the same
  env var `delete-account` reads for its own user-id HMAC, and setting it on one
  process and not the other is a safe half-state, not an error. A keyed worker
  probes its own digest first and the LEGACY one on a miss, so provisioning the
  key re-sends nothing to anyone deleted inside the table's 30-day window. All templates
  live in `email_i18n.go`, localized across six locales. A future digest reuses
  the kind with a cron enqueue + its own opt-in preference.
  `lifecycle_drip` (`handler_lifecycle_drip.go`) is the engagement sibling of
  `weekly_digest`: a NEW kind (`{user_id, template}` — `drip_onboarding` /
  `weekly_digest`: a NEW kind (`{user_id, template}` — `drip_onboarding` /
  `drip_reengagement` / `drip_streak`), but the SAME opt-in/suppression/
  unsubscribe rails. Cohort selection lives in SQL (`enqueue_lifecycle_drip()`,
  migration `20270223_001`, a daily pg_cron) — the handler honours a SEPARATE
  opt-IN pref (`email_lifecycle_drip`) + the `email_suppressions` hard-block,
  then renders the per-template copy with a stream-scoped RFC 8058 unsubscribe.
  Fail-closed on the unset SMTP credential, like the digest.
  `web_push` (`handler_web_push.go` + `push_render.go` + `internal/webpush/`)
  is the worked example for "second transport over the same notifications
  rows": the SAME notifications AFTER-INSERT fan-out, but a DIFFERENT enqueue
  trigger (gated on the recipient having a `push_subscription`), a SEPARATE
  preference (`push_notifications`, independent of the email one), a SEPARATE
  send-state column (`web_push_sent_at`), and a fan-out over the user's
  per-device browser subscriptions on `user_device_settings.prefs.push_subscription`.
  The transport is `internal/webpush/` — a dependency-light RFC 8291 (aes128gcm
  message encryption) + RFC 8292 (VAPID JWT) sender on stdlib crypto + the
  existing `golang-jwt`. A dead endpoint (404/410) is pruned via the
  `clear_push_subscription` RPC; a 429/5xx defers; gated on `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` +
  `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` (unset → rows stay pending). `native_push`
  (`internal/nativepush/` + `handler_native_push.go`) is that same shape over
  the same rows — its own enqueue gate, `native_push_sent_at` column and
  handler — sending one FCM message per registered device, iOS included.
  `strava_event` (per-activity ingest enqueued by the HTTP webhook
  endpoint at `/v1/strava/webhook`) is the worked example for
  "port a webhook Edge Function into HTTP-front + queue-back" — see
  `handler_strava_event.go` for the dispatch and
  `internal/stravahook/server.go` for the request-side validation.
  Data-export follows the request-side pattern; it doesn't fit the
  job-queue shape because the user is waiting on a signed URL — which is
  itself the remaining bound on that endpoint (decisions § 708), and
  moving it to a `jobs` kind is a client-contract change, not a
  server-side one.
- A new **`NotificationKind`** (as opposed to a new `jobs.kind`) has its own
  three-file rule, because the notifications AFTER-INSERT triggers enqueue an
  email job **and** a push job for every kind with **no allowlist**. The
  migration headers that claim "in-app only unless added to those channels'
  allowlists" (`20270107_001`, `20270208_001`) are wrong — there is no such
  allowlist, and `importantKinds` only suppresses a kind under the default
  `important` mode, not under `all`. So a new kind reaches all three channels
  immediately and needs, in the same commit:
  1. copy in `email_i18n.go` for **every** locale in `emailLocales` — or
     membership in `mailer.go`'s `inAppOnlyKinds` with the reason, which
     `shouldEmail` + `shouldPush` both honour;
  2. an explicit `pathForKind` arm in `mailer.go` whose target resolves against
     `apps/web/src/routes` **for the recipient** (the `run_completed` trap: an
     owner-scoped `/runs/{id}` renders "run not found" for a follower), plus the
     row's FK column in all three `FetchNotificationFor*` projections when the
     target is entity-scoped;
  3. an arm in the mobile inbox's `_verbFor` (`profile_screen.dart`) with strings
     in all seven ARBs, and the web `notificationsList.*` / `notificationBell.*`
     keys in all six locales.
  `notification_copy_guard_test.go` and `notification_link_guard_test.go` read
  the `NotificationKind` union out of `apps/web/src/lib/types.ts` and fail on a
  missing 1 or 2; `profile_screen_test.dart` reads the same union and fails on a
  missing 3. Before those guards existed, three kinds silently emailed "You have
  a new notification" and six rendered "{name} interacted with your activity".
  A fourth, optional piece is a **per-kind mute**: `mailer.go`'s
  `kindMutePrefKey` maps a kind to a `user_settings.prefs` key that silences it
  on the outbound channels only, for the case where the three-mode channel
  setting is too blunt (muting `email_notifications` to stop one notice also
  stops direct messages). It can only ever SUBTRACT — `kindMuted` is consulted
  inside `shouldEmail` / `shouldPush` alongside the channel mode, never instead
  of it — and both gates take the whole prefs bag rather than a pre-resolved
  mode so a new channel cannot forget to consult it. One entry today,
  `notify_data_export_ready` (`decisions.md § 729`); register any new one in
  `docs/backend/settings.md` too.
- Live-hub extensions — Redis-backed storage (swap [`internal/livehub.Hub`](internal/livehub/hub.go)
  with a Redis pub/sub-backed variant), per-run ring buffer for
  late-joiner replay of more than the most recent ping.
- **The live-ping Bridge** ([`internal/livehub/bridge.go`](internal/livehub/bridge.go),
  decisions §282) closes the transport gap during the Realtime→hub client
  rollover. The recorder and the web spectator each pick a transport at
  BUILD time (hub if `LIVE_HUB_URL`/`PUBLIC_LIVE_HUB_URL` set, else Supabase
  Realtime + `live_run_pings`), and there is no runtime failover — so a hub
  spectator watching a runner still on the legacy recorder would see an empty
  map. The Bridge is the **Realtime→hub** half: it polls `live_run_pings`
  (cursor on `id`) and republishes new rows into the matching hub room,
  gated on (a) the run having ≥1 hub subscriber and (b) the run NOT being
  hub-native (`Hub.RecentlyPushed` — a run receiving direct `/push` already
  fans out; re-forwarding its persisted rows would double-deliver). Coarse
  (in-zone SAR) rows are skipped, matching the hub push path. Single-replica
  only (holds the concrete in-process Hub + an in-memory cursor); wired in
  `main.go` when the hub is in-process and a service key is present. The
  **hub→Realtime half** (`Server.persistLivePing`, gated on
  `Server.Persister` + `Server.RunMeta`) mirrors every accepted `/push` into
  `live_run_pings` — async + best-effort — so a legacy Realtime spectator
  (every mobile spectator; old web) sees a hub-transport run. It resolves the
  run's `user_id` (NOT NULL) from the per-room run-meta cache the authorizer
  already warmed, and the Bridge's hub-native guard skips these self-inserts
  so they aren't re-forwarded. Both halves ship together, making transport
  choice irrelevant during the rollover — so **both** the web and mobile
  cutovers are safe.
- Operational concerns — backoff tuning, Prometheus metrics, leader
  election if multiple workers don't suffice. None shipped today.

**Don't build here:**

- Anything that should run on the request path. The worker is for
  background work only — synchronous user actions belong in Edge
  Functions or PostgREST.
- A second source of truth for the queue. The `jobs` table + the
  RPC trio (`claim_next_job` / `finish_job` / `defer_job`) is the
  contract; don't add a parallel queue.
- Direct Postgres connections. Everything goes through PostgREST +
  Storage REST so the worker has one transport and zero VPC-peering
  concerns when deployed to Fly.io.

## Concurrency

Multiple workers can run side by side. `claim_next_job` does
`for update skip locked` so two simultaneous claims each get a
distinct job rather than blocking. No leader election or partitioning
is needed for the foreseeable scale.

## Error classification

The worker reports back to the queue on every job:

- **success** → `finish_job(done, nil)`
- **transient** (5xx, dial timeout, connection refused, deadline) →
  `defer_job(delay_seconds, msg)`. `attempts` is *not* decremented;
  the per-job `max_attempts` ceiling still applies. Once the budget is
  spent, `defer_job` lands the row in `status='failed'` (not back in
  `queued`, where `claim_next_job`'s `attempts < max_attempts` gate
  would strand it un-claimable and invisible) so the `jobs-failed-alert`
  cron sees it — migration `20261201_001_jobs_failed_alert.sql`.
- **permanent** (4xx, malformed payload, missing run, RLS denial) →
  `finish_job(failed, msg)`.
- **panic** → caught by `dispatchSafely`'s barrier, logged with its stack, and
  reported as **permanent**. `isTransient` refuses a `*panicError` outright
  rather than letting it reach the substring sniffing below: a panic value is
  arbitrary text, and one that happens to say `i/o timeout` would otherwise
  read as a network blip worth retrying.

The classifier lives in `isTransient` in `worker.go`. It branches on
`HTTPError.StatusCode` first (typed error from `supabase.go`), then
falls back to substring sniffing the message for network-layer
markers — same shape as the watch's drain classifier in
`apps/watch_wear/.../RunViewModel.kt`.

**Why the barrier is not optional.** The worker loop runs in `main`'s own
goroutine, and `startHealthServer` mounts the live-spectator hub, the
data-export endpoints, the Strava webhook, the unsubscribe endpoint and the
bounce webhook on the SAME process. An escaping panic therefore ends live
tracking for every spectator watching every runner, not just the one job. And
the job itself would be unreachable afterwards: `claim_next_job` selects only
`status = 'queued'`, nothing moves a row back out of `running`, and
`find_stuck_jobs` (migration `20260731_001`) deliberately only alerts. Pinned
by `worker_panic_test.go`.

## Re-upload race

Closed at the DB level via a `source_track_url` CAS (migration
`20260611_001_run_matched_tracks_cas.sql`). The trigger writes
`NEW.track_url` into `run_matched_tracks.source_track_url` on every
insert and every reset; the worker captures `runs.track_url` at job
start and PATCHes the row conditionally on
`?source_track_url=eq.<value>` via `Prefer: return=representation`.
A re-upload that lands between the worker's read and write changes
`source_track_url`, the conditional PATCH affects 0 rows, the worker
client returns `ErrStaleSourceTrackURL`, and the worker logs +
returns `nil` — the OLD job ends cleanly via `finish_job(done)`,
the NEW job already queued by the trigger produces the right
result.

The pre-write `track_url` recheck is kept as a fast path: it skips
the upload + PATCH entirely when the change is already visible at
read time, saving a wasted Storage write. Defence in depth — the
CAS is what closes the actual race; the recheck is for niceness.

Pinned by:
- `TestWorker_ReuploadDuringMatchDiscardsResult` — recheck path.
- `TestWorker_StaleSourceTrackURLDiscardsResult` — CAS path
  (recheck would have passed but the row was reset under the
  worker's feet between recheck and PATCH).

If the matched gz was uploaded before the CAS rejected the PATCH,
the file is now an orphan in Storage. The worker logs the path so
an operator can sweep these later; an automated cleanup job would
be the natural follow-up.

## Deploying to production

See [deployment.md](deployment.md) — three Fly.io apps under one `project-running` org: the worker + OSRM talk over 6PN; GraphHopper (the `foot` round_trip engine for "Generate a route by distance", config in [`graphhopper/`](graphhopper/)) is reached by the generate-route Lambda on AWS over **public https**, not 6PN. Covers fly.toml shapes, Volume + graph build, weekly OSRM rebuild, secrets, rollback, DR, and the proposed `release-worker.yml` / `release-osrm.yml` / `release-graphhopper.yml` workflows.

## Local dev

See [README.md](README.md) for the smoke-test recipe.

```bash
# From apps/job_worker:
go test ./...                   # unit tests, no network
go vet ./...
go build .                      # produce a binary in cwd

# Against a running supabase stack at apps/backend:
SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321 \
  SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=$(cd ../backend && supabase status -o env | \
    awk -F= '/^SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=/ {gsub(/"/,"",$2); print $2}') \
  WORKER_ID=dev \
  go run .
```

`main.go` auto-loads `.env.development` (committed, non-secret local
defaults — the loopback Supabase URL + demo service-role key + `WORKER_ID=dev`)
at startup, layered under a gitignored `.env.local` (your real keys) and the
shell env, both of which win. So a bare `go run .` against a running local
stack works out of the box; the explicit-export form above is only needed to
override a value. Repo-wide convention: decisions §137.

Stops on SIGINT / SIGTERM.

### Notification-email env (optional)

`notification_email` jobs send only when `SMTP_HOST` is set. To exercise
the channel against the local Supabase Mailpit catcher, add to the
`go run .` invocation above:

```bash
SMTP_HOST=127.0.0.1 SMTP_PORT=54325 \
  SMTP_FROM='Threkir <noreply@threkir.com>' \
  APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:7777
```

Then insert a notification (e.g. `psql … -c "insert into notifications
(user_id, kind) values ('<uid>', 'message')"`) and watch it arrive at
`http://127.0.0.1:54324`. Production also sets `SMTP_USERNAME` +
`SMTP_PASSWORD` (Resend / SES SMTP); `SMTP_PORT` defaults to 587 and
`APP_BASE_URL` to `https://threkir.com` when unset. With `SMTP_HOST`
unset the worker drains `notification_email` jobs to done but leaves the
notification rows unstamped (pending) so a later email-enabled deploy
can still send them.

### Web-push env (optional)

`web_push` jobs send only when the VAPID keypair is set. Generate one with any
web-push keygen (`npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`, or `openssl`), put the
public half in apps/web's `PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` (so the browser subscribes),
and pass all three to the worker:

```bash
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=<base64url-uncompressed-point> \
  VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=<base64url-32-byte-scalar> \
  VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:ops@threkir.com \
  APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:7777
```

Subscribe a browser (web Settings push toggle → stores the subscription on
`user_device_settings.prefs.push_subscription`), insert a notification for that
user, and the system notification appears. `VAPID_SUBJECT` defaults to
`mailto:ops@threkir.com`; a bad keypair fails the worker at startup (exit 2). With
the keypair unset the worker drains `web_push` jobs to done but leaves the rows
unstamped (pending) so a later push-enabled deploy can still send them.

## Before reporting a task done

- `go vet ./...` clean.
- `go test ./...` passes. CI gates this — the `test-worker` job in
  `ci.yml` runs `go vet ./...` + `go test ./...` (working-directory
  `apps/job_worker`) on every PR, so a Go-side guard like
  `internal/personal_data_export_guard_test.go` now fails the build, not
  just your local run. Still run the suite locally before declaring done.
- If you added a new job kind: extended the `Worker.dispatch` switch,
  added a handler test, and updated the `kind` allowlist in any
  client-side enqueue path that reaches into `jobs` directly (only
  the runs trigger does today).
- If you swapped in a real `Matcher`: verified the new implementation
  uploads a valid gzipped JSON array (worker's `parseTrack` will fail
  on invalid bytes, which is the right behaviour — but a regression
  there would surface as queued jobs flipping to `failed`).
- Updated [../../docs/product/roadmap.md](../../docs/product/roadmap.md) §515-531 with
  the engine choice or wiring change.
