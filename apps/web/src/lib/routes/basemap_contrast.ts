/// Every colour a map overlay paints, keyed on the RESOLVED basemap.
///
/// WCAG 1.4.11 asks a non-text element that carries meaning for 3:1 against
/// what it is adjacent to, and for a map overlay that neighbour is the
/// basemap — not the page, and not the theme. Before this module the six map
/// surfaces branched on `prefers-color-scheme`, which is neither: since
/// § 489 the basemap follows the map-style *preference*, so `outdoors` under
/// a dark OS drew light-ground overlays on light ground. `basemapIsDark`
/// (`map-style-url.ts`) is the honest input; this module is the palette.
///
/// **A translucent casing cannot carry the bar.** Measured at the opacities
/// the surfaces actually use, a white casing at 0.25 over the dark sample
/// reads 2.273:1 and a `#1E1B4B` casing at 0.45 over the light sample
/// 2.710:1 — both under the floor. So every LINE here clears the floor
/// against its own basemap directly, and the casing is registered as
/// decoration that sharpens an already-compliant line rather than as the
/// thing making it visible.
///
/// A pin is the one place a separator does the work: a ring in
/// [mapOverlayOutline] clears the floor against the ground, which makes the
/// pin's boundary discernible, and the FILL inside it is then free to stay
/// a fixed identity hue (route orange, club cyan) per § 480's data line.

/// `live_run_map_tile_url_test.dart` so the two platforms grade against the
