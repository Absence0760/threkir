# Run app — product roadmap

## Status at a glance

*Snapshot 2026-06-03. The per-item checkboxes below remain the source of truth — this section is just the orientation layer on top of them.*

- **Shipped (built + tested in-repo): Phases 1, 2, 2b, 3.** Phone recording (Android + iOS), Apple Watch + Wear OS standalone recording, the SvelteKit web app, the full social layer (following + feed, kudos / comments, clubs + events, segments + leaderboards, run photos, notifications inbox, gear), AI Coach, training plans + generator + training-load / VO₂ analysis, monetisation infra (RevenueCat Pro tier), and six-locale i18n across every client.
- **In flight — Go-service production cutover.** The live-spectator WebSocket hub (+ Redis fan-out), Strava webhook, token refresh, data export, and premium endpoints are all code-complete and tested under `apps/job_worker/`. What's left is operator-only: deploy to Fly.io, point `live.threkir.com` at it, set the secrets, then flip `PUBLIC_LIVE_HUB_URL` (web) + `LIVE_HUB_URL` (mobile). No client code changes.
- **Blocked on external credentials / approval** (code built and fail-closed in every case below — these are deploy steps, not unwritten features). Garmin Connect (developer-program application), native push FCM / APNs (Firebase + APNs keys + the per-app `google-services.json` / `GoogleService-Info.plist`; the client token registration itself shipped in `push_messaging_bridge.dart`), RunSignUp race results (API key), live in-app-purchase sheets (RevenueCat dashboard config), watchOS complication (Xcode Widget Extension target).
- **In progress: Phase 4 — multi-modal gym + nutrition.** Data foundation (migration `20261204_001`) + the web **gym** module are shipped; the web cross-modality Tier-1 layer has landed — lift→load wired into the dashboard fitness curve, bounded recent-lifts + 7-day nutrition in the Coach context, self-hiding gym cards on Home, and the unified `/history` activities timeline with kind chips. The web **nutrition** module has now landed too: `/nutrition` (Mifflin-St Jeor macro rings, meal-slot log, water, weekly trend) + `/nutrition/log` (Open Food Facts search → confirm portion, manual fallback) + Settings body-metrics entry + the `body_metrics` migration. The **mobile nutrition** screens have now landed too (Android + byte-identical iOS twin: `nutrition_screen.dart` + `nutrition_log_sheet.dart` + `food_search.dart`). The **mobile shell reshape has landed (G5):** the bottom nav is `Home / History / Log / Social / Settings` with a centre Log action sheet, the Home dashboard composes self-hiding today's-lift + nutrition rings + recent-lifts cards, and a Settings → Body metrics entry (Art 9 consent-gated) feeds real nutrition targets. The **mobile cross-modality layer has now landed too:** lift→load wired into the mobile dashboard fitness curve (`lift_load.dart`), the recent-lifts trend card, and the unified mobile **History** timeline (`runs_screen.dart` + `activity_timeline_list.dart`, assembled from the local stores via `lib/local_activities.dart` — offline-first). Web's gym/nutrition surfaces were then **ungated to match mobile** (2026-06-04, [decisions §63 amendment](../architecture/decisions.md#63-single-app-multi-modal-expansion-run--gym--nutrition-under-one-nav-one-db)): the Gym + Nutrition sidebar items are always present and the dashboard cards + history chips self-hide on data presence; the `multi_modal_nav` flag is retired. The **social-feed lift cards + gym sharing have now landed too** (2026-06-12, web + mobile): a public/private toggle + copy-share-link on `/gym/[id]` (+ mobile `gym_detail_screen`), a read-only public `/share/workout/[id]` page, and lift cards in the feed via `fetchFollowingActivityFeed` (runs through `public_runs`, public lifts through `gym_workouts` RLS, merged) with a `Lift` filter chip. The web admin moderation page (`/admin/reports`) has now landed too (DB-enforced admin allow-list + triage queue; [decisions §142](../architecture/decisions.md#142-admin-authorization-is-db-enforced-via-app_admins--a-privateis_admin-oracle-never-client-side-route-gating)). Remaining: (operator) the iOS/Play privacy-form updates for body metrics + Open Food Facts. Also queued but unscheduled: an RTL locale, Protomaps self-hosted tiles, and map-matching deploy.

## Vision

A cross-platform running app that covers every device and surface a runner might use — iPhone, Android phone, Apple Watch, Wear OS, and a full desktop web app — with seamless route planning, live spectator tracking, ML-powered training plans, and free access to the features every other app puts behind a paywall.

---

## Strategic pillars

1. **MapLibre GL JS** — open-source vector maps with smooth rendering, 3D terrain, and zero vendor lock-in
2. **Watch parity** — Apple Watch and Wear OS treated as first-class platforms, not companions
3. **Free core** — route building, GPX import, and run history stay permanently free
4. **Open ecosystem** — sync with Strava, HealthKit, Health Connect, parkrun, and race results
5. **Web as a power tool** — the web app is where you plan, analyse, and manage; the phone and watch are where you run
6. **Scale-ready backend** — two-service architecture that grows from a single Supabase project to include a Go service for real-time and background processing

---

## Architecture evolution

```
Phase 1:    Supabase only (CRUD, auth, storage)
Phase 2:  + Go service    (WebSockets, background jobs)
Phase 3:    Go service handles premium features (training plans, VO2 max — rule-based)
Future:   + Python service if/when ML model training requires it
```

Full technical details in `backend_scaling.md`.

## Phase 1 — MVP: prove the core loop

**Target:** ~8 weeks
**Goal:** A working, testable app that covers plan → run → review
**Backend:** Supabase only

### GPX / KML import

✓ **Shipped.** GPX / KML / KMZ / GeoJSON / TCX import across web + Android + iOS, with instant map render and distance/elevation summary. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md). Mobile also registers as an OS handler for GPX/KML so a route shared in WhatsApp / Files / Drive can be opened straight into the library ("Open with" + share-target → route import; Android live, iOS document-open wired with the share-sheet Share Extension deferred; on-device verification pending). See [decisions.md § 297](../architecture/decisions.md#297-os-open-with--share-target-imports-a-gpxkml-as-a-route-device-led-octet-stream-is-required-for-whatsapp-ios-gets-document-open-now-and-the-share-sheet-later).

### Live GPS run recording (phone)

✓ **Shipped.** Background GPS recording on Android + iOS with live pace/distance, manual pause, laps, activity types, TTS cues, pedometer, GPS self-heal, indoor mode, and a live lock-screen notification. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Route overlay during run

✓ **Shipped.** Live position against the planned route with off-route alerts and distance-remaining projection. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Run history + basic stats

✓ **Shipped.** Run list, detail view, weekly mileage, elevation/splits, manual entry, multi-select delete, sort/filter, PBs, and the multi-goal dashboard. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Cloud sync + auth

✓ **Shipped.** Supabase Auth (email/password + OAuth scaffolding), offline-only mode, two-way sync with newer-wins conflict resolution, Strava ZIP + Health Connect import, and background sync. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Backend work (Phase 1)

✓ **Shipped.** Schema + RLS + DB functions + seed, the seven core Edge Functions, GPS tracks moved to Storage, Vault-encrypted OAuth tokens, EF rate limiting, Strava webhook validation, and MapTiler usage monitoring. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Milestone: internal TestFlight / Play Store internal track release

---

## Phase 2 — watch parity: wrist-first experience

**Target:** ~6 weeks after Phase 1
**Goal:** Both watch platforms feel like first-class running computers, not companion screens
**Backend:** Supabase + Go service

### Apple Watch standalone GPS recording

✓ **Shipped.** Standalone (no-phone) workout sessions with HealthKit HR, haptic pace alerts, lap markers + splits, a Core Motion pedometer, and Watch Connectivity sync (with a persisted pre-auth ingest queue). Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

**Lap markers + step count (2026-09-18, issue #950):** two of the eleven rows Wear OS was ahead on. Both land in `run.metadata` in the shape the registry declares, both ride the `WCSession` envelope with the phone bridge lifting them back out, and both sit in the 15 s crash checkpoint so a recovered run does not upload short. The pedometer's sensor half is **device-gated** — no watchOS simulator has one, so what has run is the baseline arithmetic and the plumbing, not `CMPedometer` itself. The `NSMotionUsageDescription` prompt ships English-only until the watch's `InfoPlist.xcstrings` lands.

### Wear OS standalone GPS recording

✓ **Shipped.** Compose-for-Wear standalone recording with HR, ultra-length (10h+) streaming, battery-saver nudges, live race mode, full Android UX parity, TTS cues, pedometer, GPS self-heal, indoor mode, and auto/manual sync. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Route navigation on watch

✓ **Shipped on Wear OS.** Route sync + pre-run picker, off-route haptic/banner, distance-to-go badge, an in-run mini-map (track-so-far overlay, raster tiles, prefetch), auto-hiding controls, and an `is_starred`-curated picker. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

**Apple Watch (2026-08-02, issue #664):** `RouteNavigator.swift` had shipped as an off-route engine with no route source and no surface, so none of it was user-reachable. Closed with an explicit per-route **Send to Apple Watch** push (`WCSession.transferUserInfo`, 512-point budget, thinned by `simplifyToBudget` rather than truncated, refused whole on any malformation) plus a `RouteGuidanceView` that renders off-route / deviation / distance-remaining during a run. Deliberately narrower than Wear OS: no on-wrist picker and no `is_starred` read — the phone chooses the route. **Not Mac-verified when written** — the Swift half had no compile or test run behind it on the Linux toolchain it was authored on; `xcodebuild build` + `xcodebuild test` have since run green on a Mac (Xcode 26.4, watchOS 26.4 simulator). The mini-map gap closed on 2026-08-21 with a tile-less SwiftUI `Canvas` map on a second run page ([decisions § 702](../architecture/decisions.md)) — build-verified + host-tested, still not device-verified.

### Glanceable tiles and complications

- [ ] watchOS complication: pace + distance — Swift source + provider + four `widgetFamily` views (Circular / Corner / Inline / Rectangular) ship in `apps/watch_ios/Complications/`. `WorkoutManager` writes an active-run snapshot to an App-Group `UserDefaults` on every state transition (`publishComplicationSnapshot`) and nudges `WidgetCenter.reloadTimelines`. **Checkbox stays unticked until the Widget Extension target is added in Xcode** — see [`apps/watch_ios/Complications/README.md`](../../apps/watch_ios/Complications/README.md) for the one-time wiring step.
- [x] Wear OS tile: active run summary — `apps/watch_wear/.../tiles/ActiveRunTileService.kt` renders idle ("Tap to start") and active (elapsed time + distance + pace) layouts via ProtoLayout. `RunRecordingService` calls `requestUpdate` on every stage transition (start / pause / resume / stop) so the tile content always matches the live recording state. Manifest entry guards the service with `BIND_TILE_PROVIDER`; preview drawable shown in the watch face's tile picker. Pure formatter unit tests + a source-level wiring guard pin the contract.

### Live spectator tracking

✓ **Shipped.** `/live/{run_id}` spectator page, pre-start share link, mobile per-ping broadcast to `live_run_pings`, the Go WebSocket hub (with Supabase Realtime fallback), and Redis-backed ephemeral position storage for late joiners. The spectator run-conclusion view (a positive `runs.concluded_at` marker → "Run complete" card + view-the-full-run CTA, plus recent-pace / course-progress enrichment) and the mobile recorder's persistent live-share indicator shipped 2026-07-23 (issue #613). Only the operator env-flip (Fly.io + Redis) remains. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Backend work (Phase 2)

- [x] Deploy Go service to Fly.io (~$5/month) — deployed 2026-07-21 as `threkir-worker` (region `ord`); see `apps/job_worker/deployment.md`
  - [x] **WebSocket hub code shipped + deploy config ready** — `apps/job_worker/internal/livehub/` (Hub + HTTP routes + WS streaming via `coder/websocket` + per-room privacy-zone clip via `SupabaseZoneFetcher`); 34 tests race-clean. Wired into `main.go`'s health listener alongside `/health`. `apps/job_worker/fly.toml` exposes `:443` (TLS + http handler for WS) with `LIVEHUB_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env + `/health` HTTP probe; env examples (`apps/web/.env.example` → `PUBLIC_LIVE_HUB_URL`, `apps/mobile_android/.env.example` → `LIVE_HUB_URL`) and `apps/job_worker/deployment.md § Live spectator hub` document the cutover. Remaining steps are operator-only: `flyctl deploy --remote-only`, `flyctl certs add live.threkir.com`, Route 53 record, then flip the two env vars in the prod sops blob + next mobile release.
  - [x] Background job queue (Postgres-backed via River-style `claim_next_job` / `defer_job` / `finish_job` RPCs)
  - [x] **Strava webhook handler (moved from Edge Function)** — HTTP endpoint at `apps/job_worker/internal/stravahook/server.go` (POST `/v1/strava/webhook`) validates URL secret + verify-token + freshness + dedupes via `webhook_events`, then enqueues a `kind='strava_event'` job; the worker handler (`internal/handler_strava_event.go`) does the activity fetch + Storage upload + runs insert async. Matches Strava's "ack within 2s" recommendation. The CHECK allowlist on `jobs.kind` (migration `20260823_001`) admits the new kind. 23 new tests across the dispatch + endpoint (race-clean). Cutover is operator-mediated via `POST /api/v3/push_subscriptions`; the EF stays deployed for rollback. See `apps/job_worker/deployment.md § Cutover recipe for the Strava webhook`.
  - [x] **Token refresh worker (moved from Edge Function)** — `kind='token_refresh'` in `apps/job_worker/internal/handler_token_refresh.go`. Sweeps `integrations` rows where `provider='strava'` and `token_expiry < now()+1h`, rotates via Strava `/oauth/token` (`grant_type=refresh_token`), persists through `set_integration_tokens` RPC. Per-row error isolation — a single user's 4xx/5xx skips that row and the sweep finishes `done`. Pluggable `StravaRefresher` seam for tests. 12 new tests (8 handler + 4 Strava client), race-clean. The `refresh-tokens` Edge Function stays deployed during cutover; the pg_cron schedule that enqueues the hourly token_refresh job lives in migration `20260821_001_token_refresh_cron.sql` (dedupe-safe — multi-tick ticks while the worker is behind coalesce onto one backlog row). `apps/backend/CLAUDE.md`'s Edge Functions table marks `refresh-tokens` Deprecated (rollback path). See `apps/job_worker/deployment.md § Job kinds + cutover`.
  - [x] **Data export worker (moved from Edge Function)** — first shipped as a synchronous HTTP endpoint (`POST /v1/export`) rather than a job kind, on the reasoning that the user is waiting on a signed URL; that reasoning did not survive contact with a backgrounded mobile app, and it IS a job kind now (`data_export`, decisions §717 + §724, endpoint deleted). New package `apps/job_worker/internal/dataexport/` with JWT auth (same `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` the live hub uses), tiered rate limit (`check_rate_limit_tiered`, free 2/h + pro 8/h, fail-closed), CSV / GPX-zip builders, Storage upload, 10-min signed URL. 14 tests, race-clean. `apps/backend/CLAUDE.md` marks the `export-data` Edge Function Deprecated (rollback path). Cutover is operator-mediated via a client-side URL flip. See `apps/job_worker/deployment.md`.
- [x] **Set up Upstash Redis for live position streams** — Go code shipped (`apps/job_worker/internal/livehub/redis_hub.go`). `LivePubSub` interface lets `main.go` pick at boot via `REDIS_URL`. Redis pub/sub on `live:{runID}:ch` for fan-out; `live:{runID}:last` for snapshot survives across process restarts with a 24h TTL. 14 miniredis-backed tests pin every contract (TTL expiry, late-joiner pre-load, subscriber drop semantics, per-room zone + run-meta caches, URL parser). Operator just needs to set the Fly secret to flip from in-process to Redis-backed.
- [x] Add `personal_records` summary table with insert trigger (migration `20260508_001_personal_records_cache.sql` — table, `refresh_personal_records_for_user(uid)` helper, insert / update / delete triggers, backfill; `security definer` writes, reads scoped to owner)
- [x] Add `jobs` table for Go worker queue (migration `20260609_001_run_match_pipeline.sql` — generic `(id, kind, payload jsonb, status, attempts, scheduled_at, locked_at, locked_by)` queue with River-style `claim_next_job` / `finish_job` / `defer_job` SECURITY DEFINER API. `for update skip locked` for safe concurrent drain; partial indexes on `(scheduled_at, kind) where status='queued'` keep the worker scan O(active set); RLS deny-by-default + revoke EXECUTE from public + grant to service_role for the worker functions. First tenant is `kind='map_match'`; strava-webhook / token-refresh / data-export now follow the same shape — see the three bullets above.)
- [x] Migrate Strava webhook, token refresh, data export from Edge Functions to Go service — code complete + tested for all three (see the sub-bullets under "Deploy Go service to Fly.io"). The Edge Functions stay deployed as rollback paths; the only remaining step is the operator-mediated cutover (provision the Fly.io worker, repoint Strava's `push_subscriptions` URL, apply the token-refresh cron migration, flip the client export URL), tracked under the unchecked "Deploy Go service to Fly.io" item above.

### Milestone: App Store + Play Store public beta

---

## Phase 2b — web app: plan big, review deep

**Target:** ~5 weeks (runs in parallel with or immediately after Phase 2)
**Goal:** A SvelteKit web app at `threkir.com` that handles everything better done on a big screen
**Backend:** No new services — database optimisations only

### Full-screen route builder

✓ **Shipped.** MapLibre click-to-place builder with road/trail snap, live distance + elevation, overlap detection, snap-to-close, place search, geolocate, GPX/KML export, and shareable links. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Run history dashboard

✓ **Shipped.** Stat cards, weekly mileage chart, calendar heatmap, PR table, recent-runs list, week/month/year toggle, and source + activity-type filters. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Deep run analysis

✓ **Shipped.** MapLibre trace, elevation profile, splits table, HR-zone breakdown, key stats, trace replay animation, and same-route comparison. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Live tracking spectator view (web)

- [x] Public page at `/live/{run_id}` (no auth required)
- [x] MapLibre map with runner dot and trace line
- [x] Live distance, elapsed time, pace stats
- [x] Pulsing "LIVE" badge
- [x] Map auto-follows runner position
- [x] Open Graph and SEO meta tags
- [x] Connect to Go service WebSocket — the spectator page takes the real `openLiveWebSocket()` path whenever `PUBLIC_LIVE_HUB_URL` is set (`lib/runs/live_hub.ts`); the Supabase Realtime channel is the fallback when it isn't, and the demo animation is only the no-signal filler. End-to-end proven against the real Go hub binary by `tests-e2e/live/spectator_websocket.spec.ts` (dedicated `playwright.livehub.config.ts`, CI job `e2e-web-livehub`): snapshot late-join + on-connect replay + live ping streaming.
- [ ] **Operator deploy only** — provision the Go live-hub (Fly.io), point `live.threkir.com` at it, set `LIVEHUB_REQUIRE_AUTH=1` + `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` + `LIVEHUB_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, then flip `PUBLIC_LIVE_HUB_URL` (web) + `LIVE_HUB_URL` (mobile). No client code changes needed — the path lights up from env alone. See `apps/job_worker/deployment.md`.

### Account and integrations management

✓ **Shipped.** Connect/disconnect for Strava/Garmin/parkrun/HealthKit, account settings, parkrun athlete number, CSV data export, and subscription management. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Public route and run pages

✓ **Shipped.** Public `/share/route/{id}` + `/share/run/{id}` pages with map/trace, stats, sign-up CTA, Open Graph + SEO meta. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Auth and data layer

✓ **Shipped.** Supabase auth store, email/password + OAuth scaffolding, auth callback + route guard, the `data.ts` access layer, and the sidebar layout. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Backend work (Phase 2b)

✓ **Shipped.** Supabase config, seed, full-text + composite dashboard indexes, and a verified sub-2s dashboard query budget at 10× target volume. The `mv_weekly_mileage` matview and its 15-min pg_cron refresh also shipped here and were **dropped again in `20270530_001`**, never having been read — the measured budget above was always met without them (decisions § 690). Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Milestone: web app live at `threkir.com`

---

## Phase 3 — growth and monetisation

**Target:** ~8 weeks after Phase 2
**Goal:** Build the features that drive acquisition, retention, and revenue
**Backend:** Supabase + Go service (premium features added to Go service)

### In-app route builder (free)

✓ **Shipped.** Mobile MapLibre click-to-place builder with road/trail snap, elevation preview, and save-to-library + share. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Community route library

✓ **Shipped.** Public/private toggle, Explore screen (search + distance/surface filters), "popular near me" PostGIS discovery, route ratings/comments, club-owned routes, reference-not-clone save-to-library, image-card share, and SEO-indexed public route pages. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Clubs and events — social layer

Phased rollout so the schema doesn't sprawl. MVP is club-owned events only, enum-based recurrence (Phase 2), and open-join clubs with invite-link sharing (Phase 2). See `docs/features/clubs.md` for surfaces and `apps/backend/supabase/migrations/20260416_001_clubs_and_events.sql` for schema.

- [x] **Phase 1 — MVP (web only):** `clubs` / `club_members` / `events` / `event_attendees` / `club_posts` tables with RLS; browse/create/view clubs, create one-off events, RSVP, owner/admin text updates. No recurrence, no invites, no notifications. Web routes: `/clubs`, `/clubs/new`, `/clubs/[slug]`, `/clubs/[slug]/events/new`, `/clubs/[slug]/events/[id]`.
- [x] **Phase 2 — recurrence + invites:** Enum recurrence (`weekly` / `biweekly` / `monthly` + `byday[]` + `until_date`) with instance expansion on the client; per-instance RSVPs (`event_attendees` pkey extended with `instance_start`); join policies (`open` / `request` / `invite`) with a pending-requests admin panel; shareable invite tokens on clubs + `/clubs/join/[token]` landing route; one-level threaded replies on posts. Migration: `20260417_001_phase2_social.sql`.
- [x] **Phase 3 — Android mirror:** `clubs_screen.dart` (Browse + My clubs), `club_detail_screen.dart` (feed / events / members tabs with threaded post replies and member post composer), `event_detail_screen.dart` (per-instance RSVP + admin update composer), `upcoming_event_card.dart` replaces the Last-Run card on the Run tab when the user has RSVP'd `going` to an event within 48h. Clubs added as a 6th bottom-nav tab. Recurrence is ported to Dart (`recurrence.dart`) so instance expansion stays consistent with web. Club/event creation is deliberately not on Android — admins still use the web app for those.
- [x] **Phase 4a — realtime (web + Android):** Supabase Realtime is enabled on `club_posts`, `event_attendees`, `club_members`, and `race_sessions` (migrations `20260418_001_social_realtime.sql` + `20260425_001_race_sessions.sql`). Web club / event detail pages and Android `ClubDetailScreen` / `EventDetailScreen` subscribe via `postgres_changes` and debounce reloads at 250ms. Payloads are ignored in favour of a fresh enriched fetch so RLS stays authoritative.
- [x] **Race organiser controls on Android (Arm / Fire Go / End).** `SocialService.armRace` / `startRace` / `endRace` mirror `apps/web/src/lib/core/data.ts`. `event_detail_screen.dart` renders a race-control card — visible to owners / admins / race directors (`ClubView.isRaceDirector`) — with the state machine `idle/finished/cancelled → Arm (+ auto-approve toggle) → armed → Fire Go / Cancel → running → End / Cancel race`. Realtime updates flow through the existing `subscribeToEvent` channel extended to include `race_sessions` filtered by `event_id`.
- [x] **Phase 4b — email delivery + event-day reminders:** The *in-app* inbox fan-out for club posts + completed runs ships (migration `20261101_001`, persona #38 — `decisions.md § 96`); the **email leg of the device-delivery layer now ships too** (migration `20261130_001`, `decisions.md § 117`). A new `event_reminder` kind + `enqueue_event_reminders()` (hourly pg_cron) creates a reminder for every `going` RSVP whose occurrence is inside the next 24 h (skips cancelled occurrences; deduped per occurrence). An AFTER-INSERT trigger on `notifications` enqueues a `notification_email` job per recipient; the Go worker's `handler_notification_email.go` drains it, honours the `user_settings.prefs.email_notifications` preference (`all | important | off`, default `important` — `docs/backend/settings.md`), resolves the address via the GoTrue admin API, and sends over SMTP (local Mailpit `:54325`; Resend/SES SMTP in prod). Credential-free and end-to-end testable against the local Docker stack — email needed no Firebase/APNs key. Admin-update fan-out rides the same `notification_email` path once an admin-update notification kind is added.
- [~] **Phase 4b — native push (FCM / APNs):** Code complete; the open half is the credential step, tracked as **Native push delivery** in [`followups.md`](followups.md). The remaining device-delivery leg — native push to iOS (APNs) + Android (FCM) — is now **built, gated on credentials** (migration `20270212_001`, `native_push` kind). A third consumer of the `notifications` rows copies the shipped `web_push` sibling: the FCM HTTP v1 + APNs HTTP/2 sender (`apps/job_worker/internal/nativepush/`) + handler (`handler_native_push.go`, reuses the `push_notifications` pref gate), the device-token-gated enqueue trigger + `clear_device_token` prune RPC, and the mobile `firebase_messaging` token registration (`push_messaging_bridge.dart`, both twins — register on sign-in, re-register on refresh, remove on sign-out, per-device `is_notifications_enabled` filter). `device_tokens` (migration `20260506_001`) finally has its client write path. Going live is blocked only on user-supplied Firebase / APNs credentials on the worker (`FCM_*` / `APNS_*`) + the per-app config files (`google-services.json` / `GoogleService-Info.plist`); unset → jobs finish done, rows stay pending, the mobile bridge no-ops. See `docs/features/native_push.md` + `decisions.md § 166`. (Web push is a separate slice — the VAPID path already ships; see `parity.md`.)
- [x] **Lifecycle + transactional email** — beyond the notification channel, the Go worker sends template-keyed `lifecycle_email`: a **welcome** on signup (`decisions.md § 119`), a **Pro-purchase receipt** + **payment-failed dunning** on subscription transitions (`decisions.md § 121`). All email is **branded HTML + plain-text** with inbox preview text, and **localized across all six locales** (`decisions.md § 120`). **Full subsystem reference: [docs/features/email.md](../features/email.md).**
- [~] **Email — engagement + remaining transactional:** Code complete; the open half is the **Email — production ops** bullet directly below, and the SMTP provisioning entry in [`followups.md`](followups.md). **weekly digest fully built incl. the pg_cron scheduler (2026-06-20, migration `20270220_001`), fail-closed on the unset SMTP credential — send gated on SMTP provisioning + CISO/counsel sign-off** (`decisions.md § 174`). The opt-in pref + RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe (`List-Unsubscribe` + `List-Unsubscribe-Post: One-Click`, digest-only) + bounce suppression all ship; the localized HTML/text digest is verified end-to-end against Mailpit. Account-deletion receipt also shipped (round 1, migration `20270217_001`). **Lifecycle drip also fully built incl. the daily pg_cron scheduler (2026-06-20, migration `20270223_001`, `decisions.md § 177`) — onboarding / re-engagement / streak nudges on the SAME digest rails (a `lifecycle_drip` jobs.kind; cohort selection in SQL; separate opt-IN `email_lifecycle_drip` pref; stream-scoped RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe at `/unsubscribe/lifecycle-drip`), fail-closed on the unset SMTP credential — send gated on SMTP provisioning + CISO/counsel sign-off.** The opt-in toggle UI for **both** engagement streams now ships (2026-06-20): web Settings → Preferences `email-weekly-digest` + `email-lifecycle-drip` checkboxes, mobile Settings → Preferences `prefsEmailWeeklyDigest` + `prefsEmailLifecycleDrip` switches, all default off and i18n'd across all six locales — the in-app equivalent of the RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe (it flips the opt-IN pref, not bypassing suppression). Data-export-ready shipped 2026-08-25 ([decisions § 729](../architecture/decisions.md), migration `20270607_001`) once export became an async job — the "export is synchronous" premise it was ruled out on no longer holds. Still NOT planned: password-changed / new-device (no auth hooks / device tracking). Reasons in [docs/features/email.md](../features/email.md#planned--not-built).
- [ ] **Email — production ops:** provision SMTP (Resend/SES) + `APP_BASE_URL` on the worker, confirm the pg_cron schedules in prod Supabase, set SPF/DKIM/DMARC on `threkir.com`. Nothing sends in prod until these land — see [docs/features/email.md § Production ops](../features/email.md#production-ops-required-before-any-email-actually-sends).
- [~] **Runners nearby — opt-in local runner discovery (issue #466):** Code complete on every client; the open half is **Deploy gate: turn the runners-nearby flag on** in [`followups.md`](followups.md). The "find runners around you" surface. **(a) Shipped unflagged:** `fetchSuggestedPeople` now factors local event co-attendance (shared clubs + shared upcoming events) — no new person-location surface. **(b) Built, gated OFF:** opt-in coarse-location nearby-people discovery behind the default-off `PUBLIC_ENABLE_NEARBY_RUNNERS` flag — a `discoverable_nearby` pref + a coarse `user_settings.discoverable_area` centroid (~1 km, never live GPS) + the `discoverable_runners_near` SECURITY DEFINER reader (centred on the caller's own area, all person-discovery filters applied, returns coarse distance buckets only) + a People-tab list + a Settings area-setter. Migration `20270424000005`, pure `nearby.ts`↔`nearby.dart` bucket helper, pgtap + Playwright + unit tests. **(c) Mobile client UI built 2026-08-21, gated OFF:** the nearby section on `people_screen.dart` + the `discoverable_nearby` switch and the `Your area` row on `settings_preferences_screen.dart` → `nearby_area_screen.dart` (place-search picker + "Forget my area"), behind the fail-closed `ENABLE_NEARBY_RUNNERS` dotenv gate (`nearby_flag.dart`, mirroring web's accepted-affirmative set) — flag off means no entry point and no RPC call at all. iOS twin mirrored. **Pre-deploy gate:** flipping the flag on (web `PUBLIC_ENABLE_NEARBY_RUNNERS` + mobile `ENABLE_NEARBY_RUNNERS`) needs owner + CISO/counsel sign-off (person-location is Art 9-adjacent). See [decisions.md § 270](../architecture/decisions.md) + [§ 701](../architecture/decisions.md).
- [x] **Typed events (run / cycle / class / social) — Slice E:** events carry a behaviour-driving `category` + free-text `discipline`; athletic affordances (route/distance/pace/race/results) self-hide for `class`/`social` in the UI **and** are blocked at the data layer. Web type-first editor + category-gated detail shipped; mobile read-only category-gated detail shipped. Migrations `20261227_001` + `20261228_001`. See [club_events.md](../features/club_events.md).
- [x] **Paid events (marketplace) — Slice P1 (web):** Stripe Connect destination charges — a host (`events.host_user_id`) charges for an **in-person** event, the platform takes an application fee, and a completed Checkout grants the RSVP. User-level `/settings/payouts` Connect onboarding, an EventEditor "Charge" toggle gated on `charges_enabled`, and a "Register · $X" flow on the event-detail page with a `?paid=1` success poll. The `stripe-events-webhook` is the sole, idempotent, service-role-only writer of order status. **Web checkout only; manual refunds via the Stripe dashboard in P1.** Schema migration `20261229_001` (`instructor_payout_accounts` / `event_pricing` / `event_orders` + `event_attendees.order_id`). **Live charge path is UNVERIFIED** — needs operator Stripe test-mode keys (`sk_test_` / `ca_` / `whsec_`); the rail, RLS, pure helpers, and non-charge UI are built + tested. **P2 buyer self-cancel + automated refund coupling now shipped (web, migration `20270303_001`, decisions §187):** the `events-cancel` EF initiates a Stripe refund (refund-eligible `paid` order) or releases the soft reservation (`pending`); `charge.refunded` flips `paid->refunded` + frees the seat via the same sole-writer webhook; `event_orders.refund_initiated_at` + a status-lock→column-lock + a buyer refund-stamp policy back a "Cancel registration" affordance with a refund-pending badge. **Live refund round-trip is UNVERIFIED** (needs operator Stripe test keys, fail-closed 503 without them); pure libs, the column-lock/policy (pgtap), and the UI (Playwright) are tested. **Still planned:** P2 waitlist notify-to-pay + reconciliation sweep; P3 mobile register (web-checkout handoff) + receipt/refund email + the class→gym seam; P4 class-pass / recurring memberships / virtual paid events / club-level pooled payouts. Gated on owner + CISO + counsel sign-off (SOC 2 / GovRAMP, PCI SAQ A, sub-processor footprint). See [club_events.md § Slice P](../features/club_events.md#slice-p--paid-registration).
- [x] **Session planner (yoga/pilates content) — P1 (web canonical + mobile read):** a reusable `session_plans` engine (blocks → timed/per-side/cue items) mirroring the gym routine engine's shape — build/save/reuse, **no execution/logging yet**. Web `SessionPlanEditor` + `/sessions` list + `/sessions/[id]` read view + a read-only sequence on the class-event detail (organiser attach). Mobile gets the `expandSessionSteps` TS↔Dart parity pair + a read/list (`SessionsScreen`/`SessionDetailScreen`; editor stays web-first). Schema migration `20270103_001` (`session_plans`/`_blocks`/`_items` + `events.session_plan_id` + the `SessionItemKind` CHECK), pgtap RLS coverage. No compliance gate (no payments). **P2 follow-along + log SHIPPED (2026-06-12, web + mobile):** the planned-vs-actual layer is merged on all platforms — `computeSessionAdherence` (on the `session_steps` pair), the `workoutDraftFromSession` seam helper, and the `gym_workouts.metadata` session trio (`session_plan_id` / `session_step_results` / `session_adherence`, owner-only, registered in [metadata.md](../backend/metadata.md)). **Web:** the `/sessions/[id]` Start control mounts the `SessionRunner` overlay (`SessionRunner.svelte` + `SessionExecutionBand.svelte`) — timed auto-advance off the cumulative axis, reps wait on Done, Pause/Resume/Skip/Abandon; on finish `workoutDraftFromSession` → `createGymWorkout` with the metadata trio; `EventEditor` gains a session-plan picker (Playwright `sessions/session_runner.spec.ts` + `runner-skip-pause.spec.ts`). **Mobile (byte-identical iOS twin):** the on-screen follow-along runner lives on `session_detail_screen.dart` (Start → timed auto-advance, Done on reps, Pause/Resume/Skip/Abandon, keep-alive + TTS cues, finish → `workoutDraftFromSession` → gym log with the metadata trio); pinned by `session_detail_visibility_test.dart`. The offline `LocalSessionStore` that landed alongside was never wired to a screen and was deleted 2026-08-24 ([decisions § 707](../architecture/decisions.md)) — the runner reads the server. **P3 sharing slice shipped (2026-06-12, web + mobile):** a logged-out public share page `/share/session/[id]` (`lookupSharedSession`) + an `is_public` toggle + copy-share-link on `/sessions/[id]` (mirrored as an owner-gated toggle on mobile `session_detail_screen` via `ApiClient.setSessionPlanPublic`); movement-name autocomplete in the web `SessionPlanEditor` (`fetchSessionMovementNames`, web-first); club-published session templates — `publishSessionAsTemplate` + a club-detail Templates surface (web + mobile) with per-row Adopt → the `clone_session_template` SECURITY DEFINER RPC (migration `20270104_001`, author/member-gated + rate-limited; pgtap `clone_session_template_test.sql`). Public read gated on `is_public` + the existing RLS (no schema change beyond the new RPC). **Planned:** the P3 curated pose catalog; P4 progression / multi-week / watch / AI sequencing. See [session_planner.md](../features/session_planner.md) + [decisions.md § 140](../architecture/decisions.md).
- [x] **Gym routine engine — P1 (web + mobile):** reusable gym routines (`gym_routines` → `gym_routine_exercises` → `gym_routine_sets` + a `gym_workouts.metadata` jsonb bag), "Save as routine" from a logged session, and "Repeat last" that prefills a new log — **prefill-only, no execution loop**. Web `/gym/routines` library (self-hiding) + builder + `[id]` detail; the `gym_routine` (`routineFromWorkout` + `prefillFromRoutine`) TS↔Dart parity pair; mobile twin (`LocalRoutineStore` + routine library/detail/builder, byte-identical iOS). DSAR export extended (Deno twin **and** the production Go worker). Four narrow-union ↔ CHECK pairs (periodisation / modality / progression / set_type). Migration `20270101_001`; Playwright + pgtap. No compliance gate. **P2/P3 execution shipped (2026-06-12, web + mobile):** `expandRoutineSteps` + the `gym_adherence` (`computeRoutineAdherence`, per-axis 80% cutoff) + `gym_progression` (`nextPrescription`) parity pairs, the `GymWorkoutRunner` (`packages/run_recorder`), the `gym_workouts.metadata` execution trio (`routine_id` / `gym_step_results` / `gym_adherence`), and the on-screen runners (web `GymSessionRunner` + `GymExecutionBand`; mobile `gym_session_screen.dart`). **P2 authoring + P4 progression UI shipped (2026-06-12, web + mobile):** the routine editor now authors supersets, per-set set-types + rest, per-exercise modality (weight×reps / time / distance / bodyweight) and a progression scheme + params (the `routine_editor_build`/`assignSupersetGroups` parity pair maps the per-row "superset with next" flag to the relational columns); session start prefills the planned targets from `nextPrescription` over logged history (the `progression_prefill`/`lastSessionSets` parity pair) and the workout review shows a neutral next-target chip — the prescriber algorithm itself is only called, never changed. **Planned:** P4 progression *engine* wiring (Coach-authored reads) stays gated on the validation-gate sign-off. See [gym_programming.md](../features/gym_programming.md).
- [x] **Timed gym work — `gym_sets.duration_s`:** a nullable `duration_s` (seconds) on `gym_sets` so planks / holds / timed intervals are first-class (no longer forced into reps/load). Threaded through `GymEditor` / `gym_compose_sheet` + the `gym_exercise_set_history` RPC; web + mobile twin; migration `20261231_001`; pgtap + Playwright + Flutter tests. Foundation for clean session-plan logging (closed `session_planner.md` open Q1). See [instructor_business.md § M2](../features/instructor_business.md).
- [x] **Attendance / check-in (host-only, distinct from RSVP):** a `class`-event organiser marks who actually showed up — a nullable `event_attendees.attendance` (`attended`/`no_show`, NULL until marked) orthogonal to RSVP `status` (paid ≠ attended), written only via the organiser-gated `mark_attendance` SECURITY DEFINER RPC (table column UPDATE on `attendance` revoked, so the RPC is the sole write path; the self-only RSVP update stays intact). Host UI web + mobile twin, read-only for non-hosts. Migration `20270102_001`; pgtap + Playwright + Flutter tests. No compliance gate. See [instructor_business.md § M6](../features/instructor_business.md).

### External platform sync

| Source | Method | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Apple HealthKit | `health` Flutter package | [x] Shipped via the `health` package's HealthKit backend; iOS import card + button now platform-labelled. No GPS traces — Apple Health doesn't expose third-party-app routes. |
| Android Health Connect | `health` Flutter package | [x] Shipped on Android via the same `health` package's Health Connect backend; pulls Google Fit / Samsung Health / Garmin / Fitbit workout summaries. No GPS traces. |
| Strava | Official OAuth 2.0 API + webhook | [x] Connect button + sync wired (`ApiClient.syncStrava` invokes the `strava-import` Edge Function with `action: 'sync'`). Native in-app OAuth on mobile via `flutter_web_auth_2` — Chrome Custom Tabs on Android, ASWebAuthenticationSession on iOS. `_connectStrava` in `settings_screen.dart` drives the auth session, parses `threkir://strava-callback?code=…&scope=…` via `parseStravaCallback`, and exchanges through `ApiClient.completeStravaOAuth` (POST `action: 'connect'`). Falls back to the old browser flow on unconfigured builds. Operational: callback URI must be allow-listed in the Strava developer console AND in `STRAVA_ALLOWED_REDIRECTS` on the EF. Webhook handler is live. |
| Garmin Connect | Official developer program (apply) | [ ] Hard-blocked on the multi-day Garmin Developer Program application. Once approved, follow the Strava pattern. |
| parkrun | Athlete number scrape | [x] Shipped on Android/iOS — Settings → Integrations → "parkrun" tile calls `ApiClient.setParkrunAthleteNumber` + `importParkrunResults` (Edge Function). |
| Race results | RunSignUp API + bib scrape | [ ] Needs a RunSignUp API key. Once provisioned, follow the parkrun pattern. |

### AI Coach (free, usage-capped)

✓ **Shipped.** Claude-powered, prompt-cached, usage-capped coach with personality tones, grounded context, SSE streaming, markdown rendering, cross-device history + archive, inline bubble actions, an OpenAI-compatible dev provider, and Pro-gated AI route descriptions. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Monetisation — Pro tier + one-off donations

✓ **Shipped.** Pro-tier revival (`decisions.md #23`): `/settings/upgrade` two-card layout, per-tier coach caps, `isPro()` registry, ConfirmDialog/Toast scaffolding, RevenueCat web + mobile SDKs, and tier-aware EF rate limiting. No features are paywalled today. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Premium tier — training and coaching (deferred, see decisions.md #18 and #23)

This section predates the Pro-tier revival and tracks features that were *originally* premium-gated (structured workout runner, plan generator, VO2 max, race predictor, recovery advisor). Under the current model (`decisions.md #23`) Pro unlocks **a higher coach daily cap (10/day vs 2/day) + priority processing** rather than gating whole features — so the items below are roadmap work, not paywall work, until product direction says otherwise.

**Structured training plan runner (workout execution):**

The foundation under both the generator and any hand-built plan: a data model for a *plan* (goal race + weeks + per-day planned workouts), the surfaces that render "today's workout" to the runner, and the execution loop that drives live pace targets from the planned workout and auto-matches recorded runs back to it. This unlocks the use case where the runner pastes a plan from a coach or a book (e.g. a 32-week marathon plan with phase-banded paces) and the app walks them through it day by day. Own feature because it's valuable with or without plan *generation* — a generated plan is just one of several inputs to the runner.

**Status: v1 shipped on Android** ([workout_execution.md](../features/workout_execution.md)) — data model, web plan editor, generator, today's-workout card, the live execution loop, and post-run auto-match all ship. The unticked items below are the genuine remaining gaps.

- [x] Data model:
  - [x] `training_plans` table: `id`, `user_id`, `name`, `goal_event_id` (nullable FK to `events`), `goal_time_seconds`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status` (`active` / `completed` / `abandoned`), `notes`
  - [x] `plan_weeks`: `id`, `plan_id`, `week_index`, `phase_label` (`base` / `build` / `race_specific` / `taper` — free-form string), `target_volume_metres`, `notes`
  - [x] `plan_workouts`: `id`, `week_id`, `scheduled_date`, `kind` (enum: `easy` / `long` / `recovery` / `tempo` / `interval` / `marathon_pace` / `race` / `rest`), `target_distance_metres`, `target_duration_seconds`, `target_pace_sec_per_km` (nullable), `target_pace_tolerance_sec` (nullable), `structure` jsonb (for structured workouts like `4×1 mi @ 7:00 w/ 1 mi easy`), `notes`, `completed_run_id` (nullable FK to `runs` once matched). Migration `20260419_001_training_plans.sql` (+ hardening `20260421_001`).
  - [x] Dart + TS type regeneration via the existing `gen:types` flow — see `docs/architecture/schema_codegen.md`
- [x] Plan editor (web-first, mobile read-only in v1) — *create + inline per-day edit + bulk-ops + the built-in starter library all ship*
  - [x] Create a plan from scratch: set goal race, date, target time, number of weeks
  - [x] Import from templates: paste markdown table, parse into weeks/workouts — `lib/training/plan_serialize.ts#parsePlanMarkdown` / `parsePlanJson` parse a pasted Markdown table (or JSON export) into the editable preview on `/plans/new` (PlanEditor import disclosure); round-trips with the export path below. *Built-in starter library shipped (`starter_plans.ts` ↔ `starter_plans.dart` — C25K / 12-week half / 16-week marathon presets instantiated through `generatePlan` via the `/plans/new` + `plan_new_screen.dart` picker, unit-tested both sides); plus club-template cloning (`clone_plan_template`) + the generator's C25K walk-run variant*
  - [x] Edit per-day workouts inline: kind, distance, target pace, notes (`WorkoutEditor.svelte`)
  - [x] Bulk operations: shift the plan forward/back by N days + mark a week as recovery (`lib/training/plan_bulk_ops.ts` — pure date-shift + recovery-scaling helpers; `/plans/[id]` owner controls orchestrate the per-row updates), plus **duplicate-a-week** via the atomic `duplicate_plan_week` RPC (migration `20261205_001`; `duplicatePlanWeek` in `data.ts`, per-week Duplicate button on `/plans/[id]`) — the insert + week-index re-index can't be done safely client-side because of the `plan_weeks (plan_id, week_index)` unique constraint, so it lives in its own SECURITY DEFINER transaction. **Mobile parity (2026-06-12):** duplicate-a-week shipped on `plan_detail_screen.dart` (`TrainingService.duplicatePlanWeek`); shift-plan / mark-recovery stay web-only
- [x] Dashboard + run-tab surfaces — the focused current-week strip shipped too (`CurrentWeekStrip.svelte` + `current_week_strip.dart`), which is what the old annotation here said was missing
  - [x] "Today's workout" card on the dashboard: type, distance, target pace, quick "Start workout" button (web dashboard + plan detail; mobile dashboard + Run tab)
  - [x] This-week view: 7-day strip with planned vs completed state per day (shipped) — the plan-anchored `CurrentWeekStrip.svelte` + `current_week_strip.dart` (the `current_week` parity pair) now render the focused current-week strip on `/plans/[id]`, alongside the existing per-week day-grids + month `PlanCalendar`
  - [x] Plan progress: weeks completed, adherence % (planned miles vs actual), long-run longest, phase marker — `lib/training/plan_progress.ts` (`orderedPlanPhases` + `longestCompletedLongRunMetres`) drives an overall base→build→peak→taper marker (current phase highlighted) + a longest-long-run stat (actual distance when the linked run is in window, else planned target) in the `/plans/[id]` header. Mobile mirror shipped — `plan_progress.dart` drives the same header markers on `plan_detail_screen.dart`
- [x] Execution loop (mobile — web isn't a GPS-recording surface):
  - [x] "Start workout" opens the run screen pre-configured: activity type from workout kind, target pace locked in, audio cues tuned to the workout's tolerance (e.g. tight band for intervals, loose band for easy runs)
  - [x] Live "workout progress" overlay during structured workouts — shows the current rep / recovery, upcoming target, reps remaining (`workout_execution_band.dart` + `packages/run_recorder/.../workout_runner.dart`)
  - [x] Post-run: the completed `run_id` auto-links to the planned workout (same day, same activity) and the workout card flips to "done" with a side-by-side comparison of planned vs actual (`autoMatchRunToPlanWorkout`)
  - [x] Manual override: runner can un-link, re-link to a different planned workout, or mark a workout as skipped without deleting it (shipped) — un-link + a workout-detail **Re-link picker** (2026-06-12, web + mobile twin — re-points a completed workout at a different owner-scoped run within ±7 days, excluding runs already linked to another workout so `plan_progress` can't double-count), plus a plan-workout **skipped** status via `plan_workouts.skipped_at` (migration `20270125_001_plan_workout_skipped.sql`; web + Android/iOS twin skip / un-skip)
- [x] Adherence feedback — web + mobile shipped (`plan_adherence.ts` ↔ `plan_adherence.dart` parity pair; the over/under-running drift banner + missed-long make-up/skip callout render on web `/plans/[id]` + Android `plan_detail_screen.dart`, 2026-06-12)
  - [x] "N of M workouts completed this week" summary
  - [x] Flag when weekly mileage drifts >20% under or over plan (both directions matter — over-running the easy weeks is a real failure mode) — `weeklyDrift` compares the current week's actual run mileage (runs dated in the week window) to its planned volume; a flagged over/under drift renders as a coloured banner on `/plans/[id]` (owner-only)
  - [x] Missed-workout recovery: suggest whether to make up a missed long run or skip it, driven by simple rules (phase + proximity to recovery week) — `missedWorkoutAdvice`: a past-and-uncompleted long run in the current week prompts make-up (base/build), or skip (taper, or a step-back week imminent — detected via a >15% next-week volume drop). Quality sessions aren't worth a dedicated make-up
- [x] Sharing and handoff:
  - [x] Export a plan as markdown or JSON (round-trip with the paste-import path) — `planToMarkdown` / `planToJson` (`lib/training/plan_serialize.ts`); the `/plans/[id]` header Export menu copies Markdown to the clipboard or downloads `.md` / `.json`. Re-importing an export reproduces the same workouts (round-trip unit-tested)
  - [x] Public plan library — users can publish a plan they followed and others can clone it into their own account. `training_plans.is_public_template` (orthogonal to the club-scoped `is_template + club_id`; migration `20270126_001`) + `clone_public_plan(template_id, start_date)` SECURITY DEFINER RPC (authorises on public visibility, not club membership; strips publisher fitness data + auto-completes the caller's active plan, same as the club path). Web `/plans/library` (search + author handle + preview) + `/plans/library/[id]` clone; owner-only Publish-to-library / Unpublish toggle on `/plans/[id]`. **Mobile parity:** `PlanLibraryScreen` + `PlanLibraryPreviewScreen` reached from the plans-list Browse-library action, plus the publish/unpublish AppBar action on plan detail. Additive RLS lets any authenticated user read a public template's weeks/workouts; non-public plans stay private.

**Scope note:** this is the single largest feature on the Phase 3 list. Budget weeks, not days. Build in this order: data model + web plan editor first (read-heavy), then dashboard "today's workout" card, then the run-tab execution loop. Structured-workout execution (intervals with live rep tracking) is the final layer and can be skipped in v1 if it blocks ship.

**Training plan generator:** shipped — `generatePlan` in `apps/web/src/lib/training/training.ts` (+ byte-twin `apps/mobile_android/lib/training.dart`), wired into `/plans/new` (web) and `plan_new_screen.dart` (mobile).
- [x] Adaptive weekly plans for 5k, 10k, half marathon, full marathon
- [x] VDOT calculation using Daniels' Running Formula
- [x] Training phase determination (base → build → peak → taper)
- [x] Workout generation: easy, tempo, interval, long run with target paces
- [x] **Adjustment based on missed sessions and recovery patterns** — *shipped: a rule-based "Re-plan remaining weeks" engine + surface (web + mobile twin), plus a trend-gated adaptive re-plan (`plan_adaptive_replan.ts` ↔ `.dart`, wired into `/plans/[id]` + `plan_detail_screen.dart`). The generator still emits a static plan; re-planning is a separate post-hoc action on the plan detail rather than a generator change.* Delivered:
  - [x] **Engine (pure):** `lib/training/plan_replan.ts#replanRemaining` ships — deterministic, rule-based, returns a future-only change diff. Honours `missedWorkoutAdvice` (a missed long run in base/build bumps the next future long run, capped at +15% so it can't spike; skipped in the taper or before a step-back), eases the next non-taper week when the last complete week over-ran (`weeklyDrift`), **never mutates the frozen past, the goal date, or the taper/race weeks**. Reuses `plan_adherence.ts`; 6 unit tests. **Dart twin shipped (2026-06-12):** `plan_replan.dart` (+ `plan_adherence.dart`) with mirror suites, wired into the mobile plan-detail re-plan flow. `plan_progress.dart` also shipped.
  - [x] **Surface:** owner-only "Re-plan remaining weeks" on `/plans/[id]` (an option in the Adjust plan dialog since 2026-09-17, decisions § 1635) — computes the diff, shows a preview panel (each change with from → to + reason), applies on confirm via per-row `updatePlanWorkout`, or toasts "on track" when nothing needs changing. Localized into all six catalogues; e2e seeds a missed long run and asserts the make-up is proposed + written. **Mobile parity (2026-06-12):** the same flow shipped on `plan_detail_screen.dart` (preview modal → apply via `TrainingService.updateWorkout`), widget-tested; an option in mobile's own Adjust plan dialog since 2026-09-17 (decisions § 1653), which also brought pause / resume to the phone.
  - **Trigger hook:** offer the action contextually when the adherence layer already flags drift or a missed long run (the banners shipped in `plan_adherence.ts`).
  - **Tests:** unit on the re-plan rules (deficit redistribution, taper-preservation, make-up insertion); e2e that seeds a plan with a missed week and asserts the future weeks change while past weeks + the race date hold.
  - **Sizing:** ~3–5 dev-days. Pure engine first, then the preview/apply UI.
- [x] **Duplicate-a-week bulk op** (split out of "Bulk operations" above) — shipped via the atomic `duplicate_plan_week(p_week_id)` SECURITY DEFINER RPC (migration `20261205_001`): INSERTs the week + its workouts, re-indexes the following weeks, and shifts dates in one transaction (the `plan_weeks (plan_id, week_index)` unique constraint rules out client orchestration). Wired into `/plans/[id]` (web) + `plan_detail_screen.dart` (mobile) via `duplicatePlanWeek`. Shift-by-N-days + mark-week-recovery also ship (`plan_bulk_ops.ts`).
- [x] Output plugs into the plan-runner data model above — the generator produces `training_plans` + `plan_weeks` + `plan_workouts` rows, same as a hand-built plan

**VO2 max estimation:** shipped — `lib/training/fitness.ts`, surfaced on the dashboard.
- [x] Estimate from pace + heart-rate data — implemented as Daniels VDOT from the best qualifying run (the original Cooper-formula note is superseded)
- [x] Track VO2 max trend over time — dashboard SVG sparkline over `fitness_snapshots`
- [x] Update after each qualifying run

**Race pace predictor:** shipped — `RaceDayPanel.svelte` (Riegel projection), mounts on plan detail within 21 days of the goal race.
- [x] Predict finish times (Riegel formula with VO2 max adjustment)
- [x] Confidence levels based on data quality — `predictionConfidence` (training.ts/.dart parity pair) grades the Riegel projection high/moderate/low from the anchoring effort's distance gap (factor vs target), recency, and qualifying-run count; surfaced as a confidence chip with a localized reason tooltip on `RaceDayPanel` (only for the data-derived path, not a user-set goal time)

**Recovery advisor:** shipped — `lib/training/training_load.ts` + `readiness.ts`; `TrainingLoadChart` (90-day fitness / fatigue / form trio) + a readiness card on the dashboard.
- [x] Acute training load (ATL) — 7-day EWMA
- [x] Chronic training load (CTL) — 42-day EWMA
- [x] Training stress balance (TSB = CTL - ATL)
- [x] Rest/easy/hard session recommendation
- [x] Days until next recommended hard session — `daysUntilNextHardSession` (fitness.ts/.dart parity pair) projects the ATL/CTL EWMAs forward at rest until TSB recovers to the hard-session threshold (−10); surfaced under the recovery-advice line on the dashboard (web `fitness-next-hard` line + mobile `FitnessCard`), shown only when ≥1 day out and not framed as a comeback

### Competitor-parity — shipped social + engagement

✓ **Shipped.** The full social layer: following graph + activity feed, the `/social` hub (Feed/People/Clubs), kudos + threaded comments, privacy zones, training-load curves, plan templates, run photos (server-side EXIF strip), segments + tiered leaderboards/crowns, the notifications inbox, and run streaks. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Elevation and pace analysis (post-run)

✓ **Shipped.** Elevation profile + split table, interactive elevation/pace crosshair, best-effort auto-detection, and same-route PB comparison. Full delivery checklist in [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md).

### Backend work (Phase 3)

- [x] Add premium endpoints to Go service — shipped under `apps/job_worker/internal/premium/`. All four endpoints mounted on the existing `/health` listener as POSTs (consistent verb regardless of whether the endpoint reads or computes): `/v1/premium/training-plan` (Riegel-derived paces + phased weekly mileage), `/v1/premium/vo2max` (Daniels VDOT from the best qualifying run in the last 90 days), `/v1/premium/race-predictor` (Riegel from best effort), `/v1/premium/recovery` (90-day EWMA CTL/ATL/TSB + advice). Gated via `user_profiles.subscription_tier` (`pro` + `lifetime` count; anything else → 402) after a shared HS256 JWT extract that mirrors the live hub's auth path. Pure-compute helpers mirror `apps/web/src/lib/training/fitness.ts` + `apps/web/src/lib/training/training.ts`. 36 tests (16 pure-compute + 20 httptest), race-clean. See `docs/product/followups.md § #12` for the full surface, test list, and cutover recipe.
- [x] Enable PostGIS extension in Supabase — shipped in migration `20260415_001_postgis_nearby_routes.sql` (extension + `routes.start_point` + GiST index + `nearby_routes` RPC + sync trigger).
- [x] Add `geom geography(LineString, 4326)` column to `routes` with spatial index — shipped in migration `20260607_001_routes_geom_linestring.sql`. Column + `routes_geom_gist` GiST index + `routes_set_geom` trigger keep the full polyline in sync with `waypoints`. Backfill rebuilds existing rows with ≥2 valid waypoints. Both client codegens treat the column as opaque; queries against it live server-side.
- [x] Add `training_plans` table for generated plans — shipped in migration `20260419_001_training_plans.sql` along with `plan_weeks` and `plan_workouts`. Hardening pass in `20260421_001_plan_hardening.sql`; editor / template surfaces in `20260420_001` and `20260524_001`.
- [x] Add `fitness_snapshots` table for VO2 max and training load history (migration `20260507_001_fitness_snapshots.sql` — `vdot`, `vo2_max`, ATL / CTL / TSB columns, `qualifying_run_count`, `source` check, `latest_fitness_snapshot()` RPC. Server-side recompute job + advisor UI still pending.)
- [x] Connect RevenueCat webhook to update `subscription_tier` in `user_profiles` — Edge Function `revenuecat-webhook` (HMAC-verified via `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) handles INITIAL_PURCHASE / RENEWAL / CANCELLATION / EXPIRATION, maps lifetime SKUs to the `lifetime` tier, and updates `user_profiles.subscription_tier` with a guard that lifetime never gets downgraded.

### Milestone: App Store + Play Store general availability

---

## Phase 4 — multi-modal: gym + nutrition

**Target:** TBD (post-Phase-3 monetisation milestone)
**Goal:** Expand from running-only to a running + gym + nutrition product inside one app per platform. The differentiator vs Strava (running silo) and MyFitnessPal (nutrition silo) is **cross-modality intelligence** — lifts in the recovery curve + a Coach that reasons across all three — surfaced through one Home and one History. (Co-located cards alone are not the wedge.)
**Architecture:** [decisions.md § 63](../architecture/decisions.md#63-single-app-multi-modal-expansion-run--gym--nutrition-under-one-nav-one-db) is the foundational ADR. **Layout & IA + hardened plan:** [docs/features/multi_modal.md](../features/multi_modal.md) (mobile-first anti-clutter IA, the inform-vs-command integration model, lift-load spec, sequencing/validation gates, sensitive-data/DSAR). **Data foundation shipped:** migration `20261204_001` (`gym_workouts`/`gym_sets`/`food_log` + `activities` view) + the `api_client` gym/food methods. (The original `runs.kind` discriminator was dropped by `20261206_001` per F1/D1 — the view projects a per-branch literal instead.)

**Sequencing (hardened — NOT parallel):** finish the Phase 3 training moat (missed-session re-planning — counters Runna, closer to revenue) → ship the nav foundation + **gym** (strong runner fit, low friction, trustworthy lift→load) → **validation gate** (measure gym engagement before committing to nutrition) → ship **nutrition, food-DB-backed** (never manual-only) → promote cross-modality intelligence first-class as each lands. Depth tiers are future work, not committed here. The §63 standalone-escape-hatch is the formal fallback if nutrition's user shape diverges.

### Navigation foundation (mobile + web)

Without this, every new modality competes for the 5-slot bottom nav.

- [x] **Mobile bottom nav** — **shipped (G5)**: `home_screen.dart` is `Home / History / Log / Social / Settings`. The `Run` tab leaves the nav; the centre `Log` slot is a raised FAB (`widgets/log_sheet.dart`) presenting Log run / Log lift / Log food, most-recently-used floats to top, long-press repeats the last modality (one-tap "start run" muscle memory preserved), ≥48 dp + a Semantics label. Picking a modality navigates to its **dwell-in capture page** (run → recorder, lift → Gym, food → Nutrition) — all three are in-shell keep-alive PageView pages, so a session (a recording, a half-built workout, the day's food log) survives navigating away. Shipped **ungated** with a `prefsKeepRunPrimary` "Run as primary action" toggle (protect-the-core-runner) rather than behind `multi_modal_nav`. Twin-mirrored to iOS.
- [x] **Home redesign (mobile + web)** — cards from every modality: today's run, today's lift, daily nutrition rings, plus the existing dashboard cards (mileage chart, training load, fitness, intensity, weekly goal). Cards self-hide when the modality has no data. **Web shipped:** a Today's-lift card + a Recent-lifts trend card + a first-run "log a lift" footer + a **Today's-nutrition rings card** (`NutritionRingsCard.svelte` — four macro rings vs targets, self-hides when no food logged today, renders unfilled when body metrics absent per the Art 9 health-consent gate, reuses the `/nutrition` target math) on `/dashboard`, all data-gated. **Mobile Home card composition shipped (G5):** `dashboard_screen.dart` composes a self-hiding today's-lift card (`widgets/gym_summary_card.dart`) + today's nutrition rings card (`widgets/nutrition_rings_card.dart`) + a recent-lifts trend card (`widgets/recent_lifts_card.dart`), each omitted when that modality has no data, 2-up on phones ≥360 dp.
- [x] **History unification (mobile + web)** — single timeline of activities (runs + lifts + meals) with filter chips. Run-detail / lift-detail / meal-detail are separate routes. **Web shipped**: `/history` is the pure unified timeline (the run-list management moved to its own dedicated `/runs` page, un-redirected — §63 amendment); All/Runs/Lifts/Meals chips over the `activities` view once a second modality has data (data-gated, no flag; every chip incl. Runs is the timeline; each single-modality tab has a `View all` → `/runs` / `/gym` / `/nutrition`; rows link to `/runs/[id]` + `/gym/[id]`; meal rows in the timeline stay read-only — the per-meal detail is the dedicated `/nutrition/[date]/[slot]` route off the day view). **Mobile shipped** (byte-identical twin): `runs_screen.dart` hosts the same chips + a day-grouped timeline (`widgets/activity_timeline_list.dart`), assembled from the **local stores** via `lib/local_activities.dart` (offline-first, not `fetchActivities`; History hydrates the gym + food stores on mount); same per-tab `View all` push; run rows open run-detail (local lookup, else `fetchRunById`), lift rows open `GymDetailScreen`, meals read-only. **Per-meal detail shipped (2026-06-12):** web `/nutrition/[date]/[slot]` + mobile `nutrition_meal_detail_screen.dart` (slot items + macro breakdown + 7-day trend), reached from the nutrition day-view meal headers.
- [x] **Web sidebar** — `Run` / `Gym` / `Nutrition` as explicit siblings. Web isn't constrained by the bottom-nav ceiling so the modalities surface directly. **Gym + Nutrition sidebar items ship, always present** (web `+layout.svelte`) — ungated to match mobile (§63 amendment); the dashboard cards + history chips self-hide on data presence.
- [x] **Feature flag** — `multi_modal_nav` per user (universal `user_settings.prefs`, `docs/backend/settings.md`). **Retired / dormant** (2026-06-04, §63 amendment): no surface reads it any more — web was ungated to rely on data presence like mobile (which never had the flag; pure-runner protection is the `prefsKeepRunPrimary` toggle). The key is kept registered as a possible future kill-switch, not deleted.

### Activity-kind data model

The DB grows a shared abstraction so cross-modality views stay sane.

- [x] Migration: broader modality discriminator. The original `runs.kind` column (`'run' | 'lift' | 'meal'`, `20261204_001`) was **dropped** by `20261206_001` (F1 / decision D1): `runs` only ever held `'run'`, so the column was vestigial. The `activities` view now projects the literal `'run'`/`'lift'`/`'meal'` per UNION branch instead. The finer-grained `activity_type` (`run | walk | cycle | hike | stroller`) is now a real `runs` column (`20261207_001`, F3), no longer a metadata key.
- [x] New tables: a `gym_workouts` parent + `gym_sets` child (one row per set within a workout), and a `food_log` table (one row per logged item). Schema kept deliberately thin for the lightweight tier; food / exercise DB tables are deferred to depth tiers. **Shipped** in `20261204_001`.
- [x] `activities` view — UNION of `runs` + `gym_workouts` + `food_log` projecting `(id, user_id, kind, started_at, summary_jsonb)`. Drives the unified History list without three round trips. **Shipped** (`security_invoker`); consumed by web History via `fetchActivities`.
- [x] RLS — owner-scoped writes, public-toggle aligned with how `runs.is_public` works today so the social layer reuses the existing follower / feed plumbing. **Shipped** in `20261204_001`.
- [x] Codegen — `npm run gen:types` + `dart run scripts/gen_dart_models.dart` run for the gym/food/activities migrations; `db_rows.dart` + `database.types.ts` carry `gym_workouts` / `gym_sets` / `food_log` (shipped). The "new `kind` CHECK" sub-task is moot: `runs.kind` was dropped (`20261206_001`) and `check_constraint_unions.mjs` correctly carries the `activity_type` pair that replaced it.

### Gym — lightweight tier

Strong app's free-form log, not its programmed-routine engine.

- [x] Web: **shipped** — `/gym` (list, PR badges) + `/gym/[id]` (detail, per-exercise PR chips, edit/delete) + the composer as a modal (`GymEditor.svelte`, exercise name as free text with history autocomplete, sets[] with reps + weight + optional RPE). Data layer in `core/data.ts`; e2e in `tests-e2e/gym/gym.spec.ts`. Followed the create-flow modal pattern rather than a standalone `/gym/new` route.
- [x] Mobile: **shipped** — `gym_screen.dart` (list + PR badges + log composer), `gym_compose_sheet.dart` (free-text exercise with history autocomplete + inline reps/weight/RPE sets), `gym_detail_screen.dart` (per-exercise PR chips + edit/delete). All offline-first through the already-shipped `LocalGymStore` (decisions §122); list stats + PR badges compute from the store's inline sets, hydrated by `api_client.fetchGymWorkoutsWithSets`. Twin-mirrored byte-for-byte to iOS ([decisions.md § 39](../architecture/decisions.md#39-mobile_android-and-mobile_ios-share-a-byte-for-byte-dart-codebase)). **Nav entry landed (G5):** `GymScreen` is reachable via the centre Log sheet ("Log lift") + the Home today's-lift card.
- [x] Personal-records per `(user, exercise_name)` — heaviest set, most volume, best rep PR (Epley e1RM). **Shipped** as the pure parity pair `gym_prs.ts` ↔ `gym_prs.dart` (17 tests each); web History rows show a "PR" badge and detail shows per-exercise chips. Home PR card pending (Home redesign).
- [x] Sharing — **shipped web + mobile (2026-06-12)**: same `is_public` pattern as runs. Web `/gym/[id]` gets a public/private toggle + copy-share-link (`setGymWorkoutPublic`) + a read-only public `/share/workout/[id]` page; mobile mirrors the toggle on `gym_detail_screen.dart`. Lift summary cards (title + set count + volume) appear in the social feed (next item).
- [ ] **Not in scope:** exercise database, workout templates, programmes, RPE-driven progression (all in the gym depth tier below).

### Nutrition — food-DB-backed (NOT manual-only)

**Hardened:** manual macro entry is dead on arrival (nobody knows the macros of "chicken bowl"); a food database is pulled forward from the depth tier — **nutrition does not ship without it.** Gated behind the gym validation gate (below). Full rationale + IA: [docs/features/multi_modal.md](../features/multi_modal.md).

- [x] Web: **shipped** — `/nutrition` (daily log + rings + weekly trends) + `/nutrition/log` (composer — **search Open Food Facts → tap → confirm portion**; manual entry only as the no-match fallback). Nutrition sidebar item always present (§63 amendment ungated web).
- [x] Mobile: **shipped** — `nutrition_screen.dart`, `nutrition_log_sheet.dart`, `food_search.dart` (Open Food Facts client, pluggable-fetcher seam), twin-mirrored. **Nav entry landed (G5):** reachable via the Log sheet ("Log food") + the Home nutrition rings card. **Barcode scan (camera) shipped (2026-06-20, mobile-only):** a Scan-barcode action in the log composer scans an EAN/UPC via `mobile_scanner` → OFF product-by-barcode lookup (`lookupBarcode`/`parseOffProduct` in the `food_search` parity pair) → confirm-portion; falls back to search / manual on no-match / scan failure (L4), camera-permission denial handled. iOS Info.plist `NSCameraUsageDescription` + Android `CAMERA` permission added.
- [x] Daily targets — Mifflin-St Jeor BMR × activity-level (`nutrition_targets` parity pair), overridable in Settings. **Shipped both sides:** web demographics card + mobile `settings_body_metrics_screen.dart` (G5) behind the Art 9 health-consent gate; **body metrics** stored as height on `user_profiles` + a `body_metrics` weight time-series (migration `20261216_001`). Mobile resolves targets via the shared `loadNutritionTargets`. **Operator carry-over:** privacy disclosures (iOS label / Play Data Safety / sub-processor list — Open Food Facts) still to update before real-user launch.
- [x] Water tracker — separate from food log, simple count of 250 ml units. Shipped web + mobile.
- [x] Weekly trends — mirrors the existing `mileage_trend_card` pattern. Shipped web + mobile (7-day calorie trend on `nutrition_screen.dart`).
- [x] Diary day navigation — **web shipped (2026-08-13, [decisions §591](../architecture/decisions.md))**: `/nutrition?date=` with a day stepper, so a past day can be reviewed and a forgotten one back-filled. The viewed day drives every window (food, that day's runs + lifts behind the exercise add-on, the 7-day trend, the water key, the per-meal deep link) and every write (composer, saved meals, recipes), resolved at save time; a malformed or future date resolves to today. Pure `nutrition/diary_day.ts`. **Mobile mirror outstanding** — tracked in [followups.md](followups.md).

### Cross-modality integration — the headline, not the afterthought

**This is the wedge** (Coach reasoning across all three + lifts in the recovery curve), not the card layout. Built first-class as each module lands, on the **inform vs command** two-tier model (see [multi_modal.md](../features/multi_modal.md)).

- [x] **Lift training-load (Tier 1):** lift sessions contribute `source='lift'`-tagged stress to the same CTL/ATL/TSB series (`liftStress` in the `training_load` parity pair), calibrated so a hard lift ≈ an easy run's TSS and capped against typos. **Run-load stays separable** so a lift bug can't corrupt run-only readiness; a calibration test pins the target. **Wired on both platforms:** web `/dashboard` feeds logged gym sessions into `computeTrainingLoadSeries` (data-gated, no flag — §63 amendment) via the pure `liftsFromSetHistory` helper, and mobile `dashboard_screen.dart` does the same via the Dart twin `lift_load.dart`, so the fitness/fatigue/form trio, recovery advice, and readiness ring all reflect lifts; the chart shows a "gym sessions included" hint.
- [x] **Coach context (Tier 1):** `coach/context.ts` reads a **bounded** recent-lifts cap (`COACH_LIFTS_CAP`) + a 7-day nutrition *summary* (daily averages, not raw rows) so prompt size + cost stay flat. Nutrition is gated on the same Art 9 health-consent as DOB/HR; lifts are ungated activity data. Daily cap unchanged.
- [x] Home composes all three modalities (self-hiding); History timeline + filter chips over the `activities` view (windowed/paginated). **Web shipped** for runs + lifts (see Home/History rows above). **Mobile shipped:** self-hiding today's-lift + nutrition rings + recent-lifts cards on `dashboard_screen.dart`, and the unified mobile **History** timeline on `runs_screen.dart` (`widgets/activity_timeline_list.dart`, assembled from the local stores via `lib/local_activities.dart` — offline-first).
- [x] Social feed extends to **lift** cards (`is_public`) — **shipped web + mobile (2026-06-12)**: `fetchFollowingActivityFeed` merges public runs (`public_runs`) + public gym workouts (`gym_workouts` owner-or-public RLS) into one window; a distinct lift card + `Lift` filter chip render on web `SocialFeed` + mobile `feed_screen`. Only headline columns surface (no notes/RPE); engagement stays run-only. **meals are not feed-shareable in v1** (privacy footgun, little upside).
- [x] **DSAR (must-fix):** `gym_workouts` / `gym_sets` (nested embed) / `food_log` / `body_metrics` / `safety_contacts` (both directions — `owner_id` + `contact_user_id`, `confirm_token` redacted) all in the data-export path (Go `dataexport` + `export-data` EF; Go completeness guard + Deno 39-spec tests); deletion already FK-cascades from `auth.users`.
- [ ] **Tier 2 (deferred, gated on data trust):** recommendation engine ("under-fuelling for tomorrow's long run", "skip the lift, CTL too high"), plan re-planning that factors fuelling + lift load, Coach-authored meal/lift plans, unified Whoop-style recovery score. Off until logging is reliable.

### Depth tiers (deferred, documented for sequencing decisions)

Not Phase 4 work — documented so future-us doesn't re-litigate scope when the lightweight modules ship.

**Gym — mid (Strong-app territory):**

- ~~Exercise database (FK from `gym_sets.exercise_id` instead of free text), with a starter set of common compounds + isolations + cardio.~~ **Shipped web + mobile (2026-06-20, migration `20270222_001`, additive).** A seeded `exercises` catalogue (~43 globals) + owner customs, with a **nullable** `gym_sets.exercise_id` FK *alongside* the existing free-text `exercise_name` (no destructive migration; PR keying unchanged; offline path intact). Composer autocomplete suggests catalogue entries; DSAR exports owner customs only. A searchable, category-filterable **browse/picker UI** ships in the composer (web + mobile twin, 2026-06-20) with an inline create-custom path; picking fills the exercise name and binds via the same normalised-key path, and free-text/offline logging is untouched. See [decisions.md § 176](../architecture/decisions.md).
- ~~Workout templates — saved routines users adopt from a library or build themselves (mirror of training-plan templates).~~ **Shipped web + mobile (2026-06-20, migration `20270226_001`).** The build-your-own side already shipped with the gym routine engine P1 (`/gym/routines` library + builder); this completes it with a **public, adoptable** library: `gym_routines.is_public_template` + a `set_gym_routine_public` owner publish/unpublish toggle + the public-template branch of `clone_gym_routine_template` + additive public-read RLS on routine/exercises/sets. The gym-routine analogue of the public PLAN library (`clone_public_plan`, `20270126_001`); orthogonal to the club-scoped templates (`20270109_001`). Web: `/gym/routines/library` (search + author handle + preview) + Adopt + an owner publish toggle on the routine detail. Mobile (byte-identical twin): a Library browse/preview screen + Adopt + the publish toggle. See [decisions.md § 182](../architecture/decisions.md) + [gym_programming.md](../features/gym_programming.md).
- ~~RPE / set-type metadata (warmup / working / dropset / failure).~~ **Shipped web + mobile (2026-06-20, migration `20270228_001`).** RPE was already a column on `gym_sets` (since the Phase 4 foundation `20261204_001`); this added `gym_sets.set_type` as a NOT NULL, default-`working`, CHECK-constrained column reusing the `gym_routine_sets.set_type` vocabulary verbatim (warmup / working / dropset / amrap / failure / backoff). Composer surfaces a per-set type picker (web `GymEditor` select + mobile `gym_compose_sheet` dropdown); detail screens chip non-working roles. DSAR exports ride the existing `gym_sets(*)` wildcard. See [decisions.md § 189](../architecture/decisions.md).

**Gym — heavy (full programming):**

- Periodised programs (linear, conjugate, block) with progressive-overload prescriptions.
- AI Coach extension: writes the program from goals + history.
- Equipment / gym-availability constraints in plan generation.

**Nutrition — mid (MyFitnessPal territory):**

- ~~Food database (USDA + Open Food Facts).~~ **Both sources shipped web + mobile (2026-06-20).** Open Food Facts (keyless) + USDA FoodData Central behind the one `food_search` TS↔Dart parity pair — `searchFoodSources` merges both (OFF first, deduped), each result labelled by source; USDA gated fail-closed on `PUBLIC_USDA_FDC_API_KEY` (web) / `USDA_FDC_API_KEY` (mobile dotenv), so unset → OFF-only. See [decisions.md § 188](../architecture/decisions.md). ~~Barcode scan (mobile-only, camera permission).~~ **Shipped 2026-06-20** — see the mobile nutrition row above.
- ~~Meal templates — saved meals users log with one tap.~~ **Shipped web + mobile (2026-06-20, migration `20270219_001`).** `meal_templates` + `meal_template_items` (owner-scoped RLS); "Save as meal" on `/nutrition` promotes the day's logged entries into a named template (`templateFromEntries`), a self-hiding templates section logs the whole meal with one tap (`entriesFromTemplate` → `food_log` rows) or deletes it; the `meal_template` TS↔Dart parity pair holds the shaping. Mobile mirror via `LocalMealTemplateStore` (offline-first) + the nutrition screen; byte-identical iOS twin. In the Art 20 DSAR export. Recipe builder (next bullet) also shipped.
- ~~Recipe builder — N ingredients → one logged meal.~~ **Shipped web + mobile (2026-06-20, migration `20270221_001`).** `recipes` + `recipe_ingredients` (sibling of meal templates); logging a recipe writes a SINGLE `food_log` row of the summed per-serving macros (each ingredient × quantity, ÷ servings) under the recipe's name. The `recipe` TS↔Dart parity pair (`recipeFromEntries` / `sumRecipe` / `logInputFromRecipe`) holds the arithmetic; `LocalRecipeStore` offline-first; byte-identical iOS twin. In the Art 20 DSAR export. See [decisions.md § 175](../architecture/decisions.md).

**Nutrition — heavy (AI-driven):**

- Photo-of-plate recognition (vision-model-based — heavy lift, expensive at scale).
- AI Coach writes the meal plan from training plan + goals + dietary preferences.
- Restaurant menu suggestions, grocery list export.

**Cross-modality depth:**

- Unified recovery score factoring lift + sleep + nutrition + run load (the "Whoop" view).
- Recommendation engine — "you're under-fuelling for tomorrow's long run" / "skip the lift, your CTL is too high".

### Standalone-product test escape hatch

If during early Phase 4 development it becomes obvious that nutrition has a very different user / market shape than running + gym, ship it as a separate app with its own Supabase project and converge later if/when the data justifies it. This is a deliberate branch, not a default — see [decisions.md § 63](../architecture/decisions.md#63-single-app-multi-modal-expansion-run--gym--nutrition-under-one-nav-one-db) for why "one app vs three apps that sync" is a binary choice with no defensible middle ground.

## Multi-language (i18n) across all clients — landed

Web already shipped seven locales (`en/de/fr/es/ja/pt-BR/pt-PT`) — see [decisions.md § 108](../architecture/decisions.md#108-web-i18n-is-detected-client-side-with-a-lazy-loaded-message-catalogue--not-an-accept-language-ssr-framework). This epic brought the same six to mobile + the two watches, each via its platform-standard mechanism, with a per-device locale that defaults to the device locale (never DB-synced). Tracked in [parity.md § App-level settings](parity.md#app-level-settings-not-in-the-registry). Mobile design: [decisions.md § 113](../architecture/decisions.md#113-mobile-i18n-uses-flutter-gen-l10n--arb-with-committed-non-synthetic-output-and-a-per-device-locale).

- [x] Mobile (Flutter): gen-l10n + ARB framework, `localeNotifier` + per-device `Preferences.locale`, language picker in Settings → Preferences, parity + negotiation + picker tests
- [x] Mobile: pilot strings migrated (nav + settings section headers) proving the path
- [x] Mobile: bulk migration of all UI strings to ARB (9 surface groups, ~1900 keys/locale)
- [x] Mobile: `intl` `DateFormat`/`NumberFormat` replacing the hand-rolled English month-name + `.` -decimal formatters
- [x] Mobile: TTS announcement locale + spoken phrases + guided-run scripts follow the active app locale (was hard-coded `en-US`)
- [x] Wear OS (Kotlin): `values-<locale>/strings.xml` resources, `stringResource` migration, locale-aware number formatting + `TtsAnnouncer` locale (device-locale-follow)
- [x] watchOS (SwiftUI): `Localizable.xcstrings` catalogue + project regions + `Measurement`/`NumberFormatter` locale formatting, plus `InfoPlist.xcstrings` for the four `NS*UsageDescription` consent prompts (2026-09-18, [decisions § 1675](../architecture/decisions.md)) — both catalogues parity-checked against one derived locale set, and the Mac `xcodebuild` is done: 225 tests green on Xcode 26.4 / watchOS 26.4, seven `.lproj` directories in the built app, and the simulator booted in `pt-PT` and `ja` renders the consent sheet in that locale. A per-locale spot-check across the rest of the UI still wants a human at the simulator (`simctl` has no touch or crown input)
- [ ] RTL (`EdgeInsetsDirectional` sweep) — deferred until an RTL catalogue (Arabic/Hebrew) is added; infra (CSS logical props on web, dirForLocale on mobile) is ready

## Future — Protomaps self-hosted tiles

Migrate from MapTiler to self-hosted map tiles using Protomaps (PMTiles format on S3 or Cloudflare R2). Eliminates per-request tile costs entirely — pay only for storage and bandwidth. Evaluate once tile API usage exceeds MapTiler free tier.

- [ ] Generate PMTiles from OpenStreetMap planet extract
- [ ] Host on Cloudflare R2 (or S3)
- [ ] Point MapLibre style URL to self-hosted tiles
- [ ] Remove MapTiler dependency

## Future — Map matching (Strava / Nike Run Club quality)

Snap recorded tracks to the road/path network so the rendered line sits on the actual route rather than drifting with GPS noise. This is what Strava, Nike Run Club, and Google Fit do server-side to produce their clean, road-aligned traces. Consumer phone GPS is 3–8 m accurate on open sky and worse in urban areas — no amount of client-side smoothing can correct that bias, only map matching can.

The target is **professional-grade Hidden Markov Model map matching**, the same family of algorithms used by Strava et al. Open-source reference implementations: [Valhalla Meili](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/tree/master/src/meili), [OSRM `/match`](https://project-osrm.org/docs/v5.24.0/api/#match-service), [GraphHopper map matching](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/tree/master/map-matching). All three take a raw GPS trace + OSM road data and return a snapped polyline.

- [ ] Stand up a backend map-matching service:
  - [x] Pick one of Valhalla Meili, OSRM, or GraphHopper — evaluate on running-specific tracks (trails, parks, urban grid). Picked **OSRM** for the first cut: lightweight (single binary, no JVM), `/match/v1/foot` is a single-call HMM snap, foot profile (`/opt/foot.lua`) keeps parks + trails in the graph. Local dev stack lives at `apps/job_worker/osrm/` (Geofabrik PBF + `osrm-extract` / `partition` / `customize` Makefile + `docker compose up`). `OSRMMatcher` in `apps/job_worker/internal/matcher_osrm.go` is wired in `main.go` whenever `OSRM_URL` is set; otherwise the worker stays on the passthrough so the rest of the pipeline can be exercised without an engine.
  - [ ] Deploy alongside Supabase (Docker image + OSM extract for target region, start country-level then global)
  - [ ] OSM extract refresh pipeline (monthly diffs from Geofabrik)
  - [ ] Expose as an authenticated endpoint (`POST /runs/:id/match`)
- [x] Wire up sync path:
  - [x] `ApiClient.saveRun` triggers matching on the backend after upload — implicit via the `runs_enqueue_match_job_trigger` (migration `20260609_001_run_match_pipeline.sql`), so every successful track upload auto-creates a `pending` `run_matched_tracks` row + a `kind='map_match'` job. Re-uploads (UPDATE OF track_url) reset state and re-enqueue idempotently.
  - [x] Store both the raw and matched tracks (so future re-matching with better data/algorithms is possible) — `run_matched_tracks (run_id PK, status, matched_track_url, attempts, matched_at, algorithm, algorithm_version, error_message)` carries the matched-side state in a side table; `runs.track_url` stays the canonical raw track. Side-table shape leaves the rarely-read state out of the hot list-query path and lets the worker write under service-role without widening RLS on `runs`.
  - [x] Return the matched geometry to the client for display — Go worker (`apps/job_worker/`) computes + uploads a `.matched.json.gz` blob and PATCHes `run_matched_tracks.status='matched'`. Default matcher is `PassthroughMatcher` (visually identical to raw); set `OSRM_URL` to switch the worker over to `OSRMMatcher` against the local OSRM stack at `apps/job_worker/osrm/`. **Web read path** (`apps/web/src/lib/core/data.ts:fetchRunMatchedTrack` + `/runs/[id]` swaps `RunMap.track` to the matched line when present, surfaces `pending` / `failed` / `skipped` via a corner pill) **and mobile read path** (`ApiClient.fetchRunMatchedTrack` + `run_detail_screen.dart` swaps `LiveRunMap.track` via `_matchInfo?.hasRenderableTrack` + `_MatchStatusPill` for non-matched states) are both wired.
- [x] Client display:
  - [x] `run_detail_screen` prefers the matched track when available, falls back to raw — `run_detail_screen.dart:522-524` `mapTrack = _matchInfo?.hasRenderableTrack == true ? _matchInfo!.track! : run.track`. Stats (splits, HR zones, elevation) keep deriving from `run.track` because those are properties of what the runner did, not how the line is drawn.
  - [x] `live_run_map` during recording still shows the raw track (live matching is out of scope — it's too slow and too expensive per fix) — implicit: `_maybeFetchMatchedTrack` only fires from `run_detail_screen`'s `initState`; the recording surface (`run_screen.dart`) never calls into it.
  - [x] Toggle in settings to show raw vs matched (for debugging / verification) — mobile **Settings → Preferences → "Show raw GPS track"** (`Preferences.showRawTrack`, per-device, off by default). When on, `run_detail_screen` forces the raw recorded line via the pure `displayedRunTrack(run.track, _matchInfo, showRaw:)` selector even when a matched track exists; stats still derive from `run.track`. Mobile-only (web isn't a GPS-recording surface).
- [ ] Privacy & reliability:
  - [x] Graceful offline fallback — if the backend is unreachable, show the raw track and retry matching on next sync — mobile (`run_detail_screen.dart`). The matched-track read distinguishes a transport/unreachable error (`isMatchUnreachableError` in `core_models/run_match_info.dart`) from a server verdict: an offline read keeps the raw track rendering (L1, never broken) and shows an honest "Offline — showing raw track, will retry" pill (`MatchPillKind.offline`, `runDetailMatchOffline`) instead of a hard error or a misleading status. A `matched` row whose gz can't be downloaded carries `RunMatchInfo.trackUnreachable` → same offline state. The screen subscribes to connectivity and re-fetches on reconnect, but **bounded + idempotent** via `shouldRetryMatchFetch` — only an unread / still-`pending` / unreachable-`matched` state re-hits the backend; a terminal `failed`/`skipped`/already-rendered run never does. Pure selectors (`matchPillKind`, `shouldRetryMatchFetch`, `isMatchUnreachableError`) are unit-tested in `core_models/test/run_match_info_test.dart`; the raw-fallback-on-offline case is pinned in `apps/mobile_android/test/show_raw_track_test.dart`. Each effect is wrapped per the L4 layered-resilience rule. Web isn't a GPS-recording surface, so this is mobile-only.
  - [ ] Self-hosted from day one to avoid sending user tracks to a third party
- [ ] Stretch: on-device map matching for fully-offline users. Port or FFI-wrap one of the engines above — multi-week effort, revisit once the backend version is proven.

Interim mitigation (shipped): polyline smoothing at render time in `LiveRunMap._smoothTrack`. Reduces GPS zig-zag but cannot correct systematic offset from the road — only map matching can.

## Future — Cross-platform parity enforcement

A structural fix for the ongoing problem of Android, iOS, web, and watch clients silently drifting out of sync. We've already paid the cost several times — `activity_type` stored on mobile but not displayed on web, `surface` stored by web but dropped by mobile, `moving_time` computed on one platform but not the others, Google Sign-In on web but not Android. Each one was a manual hunt to find and patch. The goal of this initiative is to make drift **impossible to merge without noticing**.

Three layers, in priority order — each is self-contained, you can ship one without the others.

### 1. Auto-generate DTO types from the Supabase schema

The database schema is the single source of truth. Today, each client hand-writes its own row-to-model mapping (`ApiClient._runFromRow` in Dart, `Run` interface + `fetchRunById` in TypeScript) and they silently diverge when the schema changes. Replace hand-written types with generated ones.

- [x] **Web**: `npm run gen:types` (in `apps/backend`) runs `supabase gen types typescript --local` and writes `apps/web/src/lib/database.types.ts`. `apps/web/src/lib/types.ts` derives `Run` / `Route` / `Integration` / `UserProfile` from `Database['public']['Tables'][...]['Row']`, overriding only the client-side augmentations (narrow unions for `source`/`surface`/`provider`, lazy `track` field, looser `metadata`).
- [x] **CI check**: new `parity-types` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` starts local Supabase, runs `npm run gen:types:check`, and fails the build when the committed `database.types.ts` diverges from the schema.
- [x] **Mobile (Dart)**: shipped a local generator (`scripts/gen_dart_models.dart`) that parses `apps/backend/supabase/migrations/*.sql` and emits `packages/core_models/lib/src/generated/db_rows.dart` with `RunRow` / `RouteRow` / `IntegrationRow` / `UserProfileRow` classes plus column-name constants. Chose the custom script over `supadart` / `supabase_codegen` to avoid a dependency-evaluation rabbit-hole on a 4-table schema.
- [x] `ApiClient.saveRun` / `saveRoute` / `_runFromRow` / `_routeFromRow` now route through the generated row classes and column constants, so a column rename in a migration surfaces as a compile error in Dart after regeneration. The hand-written domain `Run` / `Route` / `Waypoint` classes stay for their richer ergonomics (`Duration`, `RunSource` enum, camelCase), but are constructed from / serialized through the generated rows.

**Expected effect**: adding `metadata.steps` on mobile last week would have caused an immediate TypeScript compile error on the web until it was consumed there. Schema-level drift becomes structurally impossible.

### 2. Living feature parity matrix

A single markdown table that lists every user-visible feature with a checkmark per platform. Reviewed during every PR that adds or changes a feature.

- [x] New section in `docs/product/features.md` (or a new `docs/product/parity.md`) with a table: **Feature × [Android, iOS, Web, Wear OS, Apple Watch]**, each cell `✓` / `✗` / `Partial` / `N/A`. Shipped as [`docs/product/parity.md`](parity.md).
- [x] Link from each feature's "Phase X" entry in `docs/product/features.md` to its row in the matrix. Each feature's spec now has a `**Parity:** [see matrix](parity.md#...)` line immediately under its header.
- [x] PR template checkbox: "Updated the feature parity matrix if this PR adds or changes a user-visible feature." Lives in [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](../../.github/pull_request_template.md) under *Docs checklist*.
- [x] Periodically audit: grep the matrix for rows with mismatched ticks, confirm each asymmetry is intentional (e.g. Android has a pedometer, web can't have one — that's a permanent `✗`), and open follow-up tickets for unintentional gaps. **Last audited: 2026-06-20** — every non-uniform row checked against the source. Found + fixed two factually-wrong cells (race-time predictor cells inverted; matched-track display on mobile wrongly `✗`); confirmed the rest of the asymmetries intentional (iOS twin convention, web-can't-record `N/A`, web-canonical back-office, watch recording-only). Recorded the recurring intentional-asymmetry patterns in [`parity.md` § Intentional asymmetries](parity.md#intentional-asymmetries-dont-re-flag-these) so future passes don't re-flag them; no new unintentional gaps beyond what `followups.md` already tracks.

**Expected effect**: the `activity_type` / `surface` / `moving_time` drift we spent hours hunting becomes visible on page load. Asymmetries are either documented-as-intentional or immediately visible as bugs.

### 3. Cross-client integration test in CI

Single automated test that writes a run via one client and reads it via another, asserting round-trip equality on every field.

- [x] Start local Supabase (`supabase start`) in CI. The `cross-client-roundtrip` job in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) boots the stack via the shared `start-supabase` composite action.
- [x] Dart integration test: `api_client.saveRun(<fixture>)` against the local instance. [`packages/api_client/test/cross_client_roundtrip_test.dart`](../../packages/api_client/test/cross_client_roundtrip_test.dart) — saves a fixture run (distance, duration, source, `activity_type`, `metadata.steps` as an int, `metadata.age_grade` as a float, a 3-point track) and emits the expected-field fixture JSON.
- [x] Node script: fetch the same run via the web's `fetchRunById` shape and `parseInt(run.metadata?.steps)` etc., assert deep equality with the fixture. [`apps/web/scripts/cross_client_roundtrip_read.mjs`](../../apps/web/scripts/cross_client_roundtrip_read.mjs) — re-reads through the exact `fetchRunById` query shape + the real `parseRunSource` from `src/lib/types`, asserts all fields (incl. `started_at` instant, `metadata.steps` is a JSON number, the float `age_grade`, and the gzipped track decode).
- [x] Run on every PR. Red if any field round-trips incorrectly. The Node half exits non-zero on any mismatch.
- [x] **Routes round-trip.** A route saved by the Dart `api_client.saveRoute` reads back field-for-field through the web's `fetchRouteById` shape. [`packages/api_client/test/cross_client_roundtrip_route_test.dart`](../../packages/api_client/test/cross_client_roundtrip_route_test.dart) (write half — name, 3-point waypoints with `ele`, distance, elevation gain, `RouteSurface` `'trail'`, tags, `is_public`, description) → [`apps/web/scripts/cross_client_roundtrip_route_read.mjs`](../../apps/web/scripts/cross_client_roundtrip_route_read.mjs) (read half — re-reads through `fetchRouteById`'s owner shape + the real `parseRouteSurface` from `src/lib/types`, asserts the waypoint array structure, the surface narrow union, and that the trigger-owned `shadow_hidden` column round-trips false **and** is stripped from the read shape). Wired into the same `cross-client-roundtrip` CI job (extended, not parallel) — runs on every PR after the runs half, red on any mismatch.
- [x] **In-progress (live spectator) run round-trip.** An in-progress run opened by the Dart `api_client.beginLiveBroadcast` + a few `live_run_pings` appended via `insertLivePing` read back field-for-field through the web's `/live/[id]` spectator read shapes. [`packages/api_client/test/cross_client_roundtrip_live_test.dart`](../../packages/api_client/test/cross_client_roundtrip_live_test.dart) (write half — a stub `runs` row + 3 out-of-zone pings carrying `lat`/`lng`/`ele`/`distance_m`/`elapsed_s`) → [`apps/web/scripts/cross_client_roundtrip_live_read.mjs`](../../apps/web/scripts/cross_client_roundtrip_live_read.mjs) (read half — re-reads the run through the `public_runs` visibility view + the pings through the `live_run_pings` catch-up query ordered by `at asc`, asserts the per-ping fields in chronological order, that the stub run is visible via `public_runs` at all (the `is_public` round-trip), the `started_at` instant, the stub `distance_m`, and that the trigger-owned `coarse` column round-trips false). Wired into the same `cross-client-roundtrip` CI job (extended, not parallel) — runs on every PR after the routes half, red on any mismatch.
- [x] **Sync-path round-trip.** A run saved by the Dart `api_client.saveRun` WITH a track, then re-saved through the mobile sync semantics — a newer-wins, metadata-only edit (empty `track` + the existing `metadata['track_url']` carried forward) — reads back field-for-field through the web's `fetchRunById` shape with the edit applied AND the original GPS trace intact. [`packages/api_client/test/cross_client_roundtrip_sync_test.dart`](../../packages/api_client/test/cross_client_roundtrip_sync_test.dart) (write half — first save uploads a 4-point track; second save edits distance / duration / `metadata.steps` / adds `notes` while preserving `track_url`) → [`apps/web/scripts/cross_client_roundtrip_sync_read.mjs`](../../apps/web/scripts/cross_client_roundtrip_sync_read.mjs) (read half — re-reads through `fetchRunById`'s exact shape + the real `parseRunSource`, asserts the newer-wins values overwrote the stale stats and that `track_url` + the original trace survived the metadata-only edit — the recurring sync-conflict drift class). Wired into the same `cross-client-roundtrip` CI job (extended, not parallel) — runs on every PR after the live half, red on any mismatch.
- [ ] Extend to auth flows over time. **(Stretch — not yet built.)** The runs + routes + in-progress-run + sync-path round-trips shipped; the auth round-trip follows the same Dart-write → Node-read fixture pattern.

**Expected effect**: the last line of defence — catches drift that slips past type generation (e.g. metadata fields that are untyped `Json` on both sides) and past the human parity matrix check.

### Non-goal: full backend rewrite

A proper backend API (Go / Node / Rust) where all business logic lives server-side would structurally prevent most of this drift by giving clients nothing to drift *from*. But it's a 2–4 week refactor and only pays off with 3+ actively-developed clients. Revisit if the app ever has a paying user base large enough to justify the engineering spend.

### Recommended order

Do **#1 first** — it's a 15-minute setup per client and removes a whole class of bugs permanently.
Then **#2** — 30-minute doc edit, self-correcting via reviews.
Then **#3** when the first two catch enough to prove their value but leave residual drift worth automating away.

## Shipped — Windowed / paged local stores for very large activity history

The offline-first mobile stores (`LocalRunStore`, `LocalGymStore`, `LocalFoodStore`) used to load **every** row into memory on init. They now keep a compact on-disk **summary index** (`index.json`, one lightweight `RunSummary`/summary per row) and hydrate only a **resident window** of full rows — so cold-load reads ONE index file instead of N per-row files, and full `Run` objects (with their GPS tracks + bulky metadata) are capped while the lightweight index still covers the whole history. See [decisions.md § 135](../architecture/decisions.md#135-durable-per-store-summary-index--windowed-hydration-for-the-offline-first-local-stores).

- [x] **Windowed read API** — `LocalRunStore` exposes `summaries` / `summaryRuns` (full-history, track-less), `runs` (resident window ∪ all unsynced), `runById` (resident → disk hydrate), `recentWindow(N)`, `hydrateOlder(N)`, `hasRun(id)`; `OfflineSyncStore` (gym/food) adds `summaryOf` + `loadInWindow` / `estimateRowsInWindow`.
- [x] **`buildLocalActivities` + run-list pagination against the windowed API** — the History timeline reads `recentWindow()`; `runs_screen` filters / sorts / summarises over the full-history index and resolves only the visible page to resident full runs (hydrating older rows + detail-nav via `runById`).
- [x] **Index-first cold-load + self-heal** — a valid index whose id-set matches the on-disk run files is reused (fast path); a missing / corrupt / drifted index falls back to the full parallel walk and rebuilds (post-crash self-heal + first-launch migration). All-history consumers (dashboard, fitness, mileage, goals, recap, gear backfill, period summary, import dedup) read the index; dashboard PBs read the authoritative server `personal_records` cache.
- [x] **Sync never holds the full set** — the drain works the always-resident unsynced subset (`unsyncedRuns`), and the index is maintained as a batched, atomic, crash-safe sidecar (never a per-row write).

The profiling-to-find-a-threshold step was made moot by the design: cold-load is now bounded by the window + a single index decode regardless of total history, so there's no scale at which it degrades to the old O(n) behaviour.

## Future — Hardware: ultra-marathon-optimized watch

**Status: research only. Tier 2+ not committed.** See [decisions.md § 71](../architecture/decisions.md#71-own-hardware-an-ultra-marathon-watch-stays-research-only-watch-development-is-deferred-indefinitely) for the original deferral and its 2026-05-28 amendment (which permits tier-1 owner-personal bench-prototype work but binds tier 2+ to the original gates).

**Full dedicated roadmap** — per-tier status, the three strategic vectors, the per-step bring-up checklist, and unresolved planning questions — lives at [`docs/custom_watch/roadmap.md`](../custom_watch/roadmap.md). This section is just a parking-lot stub so the watch shows up in the main roadmap; the detail belongs with the other watch research.

A purpose-built wrist device for ultra-marathon use — 100+ hour GPS battery life, dual-band GNSS for foliage / canyon accuracy, Sharp MIP always-on display, 5-button layout, offline vector maps, IPX7. Targets the niche Garmin Fenix / COROS Vertix / Suunto Vertical own today. Full research lives at [`docs/custom_watch/`](../custom_watch/README.md):

- [Vision](../custom_watch/vision.md) — why ultra (not road or general-purpose smartwatch), the product requirements that fall out of that niche, the competitive set
- [Competitive landscape](../custom_watch/competitive_landscape.md) — frank read on what's unbeatable (chip-level hardware, GNSS algorithm IP, brand trust, retail), what's exploitable (Garmin's hostile UI, weak community, glacial updates), and the three asymmetric strategic vectors that beat building your own watch
- [BOM](../custom_watch/bom.md) — component picks per subsystem (Ambiq Apollo510B MCU, Sony CXD5610 dual-band GNSS, Maxim MAX86177 HR, Sharp Memory LCD, Bosch BMP581), ~$114 production BOM at 10k units (post-[§ 90](../architecture/decisions.md#90-bom-refresh-2026-05-28--apollo510b--bmp581-swap-ins-supply-alternates-qualified) refresh)
- [Prototyping](../custom_watch/prototyping.md) — three honest cost tiers: $1–2k bench prototype, $15–250k wearable prototype, $300–600k VC-demo / production-intent unit
- [Performance path](../custom_watch/performance_path.md) — where battery life actually comes from: big levers (display, MCU, GNSS chip, sensor coprocessor) vs medium (DMA, tickless RTOS, partial display, multi-rail PMIC) vs the small ones that don't move the needle (RTOS / language / compiler / UI library)
- [Firmware](../custom_watch/firmware.md) — original Zephyr proposal + Supabase-integration design. Superseded by [§ 80](../architecture/decisions.md#80-tier-1-firmware-uses-embassy-on-rust-on-the-nordic-nrf52840--chosen-for-memory-safety-tooling-and-async-ergonomics-not-for-performance) which picked Embassy + Rust for tier 1; reads as the fallback spec
- [Parts](../custom_watch/parts.md) — active tier-1 shopping list (~$300 silicon + $200-900 bench tools) with order checkboxes

The unticked items below are the gates that would have to flip before *tier 2+* becomes real work. **Tier-1 bench-prototype work is happening now** on the owner-personal path per the §71 amendment — the active workspace is at [`apps/custom_watch/`](../../apps/custom_watch/README.md).

- [ ] Trigger (a): app has a paying user base large enough to fund a parallel hardware effort without starving the software roadmap
- [ ] Trigger (b): an existing ODM (Mobvoi, Huami/Zepp, etc.) approaches us about a white-label firmware deal
- [ ] Trigger (c): a co-founder with shipped-consumer-hardware experience joins the project
- [ ] None of the above — keep `docs/custom_watch/` strategic content frozen at its current resolution; tier-1 owner-personal work continues under the §71 amendment but tier 2+ stays gated

Tier-1 (~$1–2k parts + 3–6 months of evenings) validates that the firmware skeleton works end-to-end against the existing backend. Anything past it — wearable prototype, production-intent unit, retail launch — requires a real team and a real budget and remains gated on the triggers above.

## Deferred from Phase 1 (Android-specific)

These were considered during Android implementation and intentionally pushed to a later phase because they need server-side credentials, OAuth flows, or device APIs that don't fit a quick incremental change:

- **OAuth sign-in (Google/Apple)** on Android — only email/password works against the same Supabase backend as the web app. Needs deep link config and Android signing setup. Tracked under Phase 3 — see "External platform sync".
- **Strava and parkrun integrations** — moved to Phase 3 ("External platform sync"). Removed from the Android Settings UI in the meantime to avoid placeholder buttons.
- ~~**Heart rate from Bluetooth devices**~~ — shipped: `lib/ble_heart_rate.dart` with `flutter_blue_plus` against BLE Heart Rate Service 0x180D / characteristic 0x2A37, pairing UI in Settings, live BPM row during recording, `avg_bpm` written to `metadata` on save.
- **Persistent disk tile cache** — currently in-memory only via flutter_map_cache. Persistent caching needs Hive or sqlite init.
- ~~**Voice cues at custom intervals**~~ — shipped: configurable split interval in Settings (500m, 1km, 2km, 5km, or 0.5/1/2/5 mi).
- ~~**History filter by activity type**~~ — shipped: filter chips on the History screen (All / Run / Walk / Cycle / Hike).

## Known issues — runs storage + bulk import

The move from `runs.track` jsonb to Supabase Storage and the Strava/Health Connect bulk importers landed together. A few rough edges were left to fix in follow-up work:

### Real bugs (fix before shipping the importer to real users)

- [x] **External ID collision on re-import.** `ApiClient.saveRun` now upserts with `onConflict: 'external_id'` when `externalId` is set, so re-imports update the existing row.
- [x] **Storage object leak when runs are deleted.** `ApiClient.deleteRun` now deletes both the row and the gzipped track file from the `runs` Storage bucket. Wired into `RunDetailScreen` and `RunsScreen` bulk-delete flows.
- [x] **Public share pages can't read GPS tracks.** Added `is_public` column to `runs` table (migration `20260413_001_public_runs.sql`), RLS policy for anonymous read of public runs, Storage RLS policy for anonymous track download. Web share page uses `fetchPublicRun()`. Mobile share flow calls `makeRunPublic()` before opening the share sheet.

### Performance / UX improvements

- [x] **Bulk import is N serial round trips.** `ApiClient.saveRunsBatch` uploads tracks in parallel groups of 8 and upserts rows in chunks of 100. `ImportScreen` saves locally first, then batch-pushes to the cloud.
- [x] **Redundant track re-uploads on edit.** `saveRun` now preserves the existing `track_url` from metadata when the track list is empty, skipping the storage upload for metadata-only edits.
- [x] **Local duplication of tracks.** `RunDetailScreen._maybeFetchTrack` no longer persists the fetched track back to `LocalRunStore` — the track stays in Supabase Storage and is re-fetched on demand (fast via dio HTTP cache). Eliminates the ~300 MB on-device bloat.
- [x] **FIT file parsing** for Strava imports. A custom `FitParser` in `packages/gpx_parser` reads GPS record messages from FIT binary files. Strava importer now handles GPX, TCX, and FIT tracks.
- [x] **WorkManager-based periodic background sync.** `background_sync.dart` registers a periodic WorkManager task (hourly, network-connected constraint) that pushes unsynced runs when the app is closed.
- [x] **Backup ZIP scales to thousands of runs.** `BackupService` rewritten in May 2026 to stream to disk via `ZipFileEncoder` + lazy-decode via `InputFileStream` + download tracks in bounded-concurrency batches. Peak heap drops from ~300 MB to ~5 MB at 5 000 runs; OOM risk on mid-tier Android is gone. See `decisions.md § 66`.
- [x] **Server-side backup with `format=backup`.** The Go data-export service (`apps/job_worker/internal/dataexport/`) gained a `format=backup` mode that emits the run-app-backup v1 shape — manifest + runs.json + routes.json + profile.json + per-run tracks/{id}.json.gz (raw gzipped bytes archived verbatim) plus the personal-data table set. See `decisions.md § 66`. **Superseded twice since:** the run cap is gone (§708 — the archive streams, so there is no ceiling to fall back from) and the rail is queued (§717 web, §724 mobile). Mobile no longer "tries the server first and falls through": the silent fall-back hid a refused Art 20 request behind the narrower on-device archive, so the two are separate tiles now and every server refusal is surfaced.
- [x] **Web backup streams to disk.** `apps/web/src/lib/backup/backup.ts` now delegates to `buildBackupZip` in `backup_writer.ts`, which uses `@zip.js/zip.js`'s `BlobWriter` + `ZipWriter` to flush each entry's bytes to the underlying Blob (disk-backed on Chrome >250 KB) and `Promise.allSettled` in batches of 6 for parallel track downloads. JS-heap pressure no longer scales with archive size; browser tabs survive 5 000-run backups. See `decisions.md § 66`.

## Open risks

- **Apple Watch native Swift** adds a separate codebase. Scope carefully — keep the watch app lean (record + navigate only) and leave analytics on the phone.
- **parkrun scraping** can break without notice. Build it as a best-effort feature with graceful degradation.
- **Garmin Connect** developer program requires business approval. Do not block Phase 3 on this — use HealthKit/Health Connect as the primary Garmin data path for early users.
- **Map tile hosting** — MapTiler free tier covers early growth. Migrate to Protomaps (self-hosted PMTiles on S3/R2) when tile costs matter. This is on the roadmap.
- **Web app scope creep** — the web app is a power tool, not a second mobile app. Resist the urge to replicate every mobile screen. Keep it focused on route building, analytics, and account management.
- **Live tracking battery drain** — Publishing GPS every 3 seconds over WebSocket adds battery cost. Make it opt-in per run, not default. Test drain target: <5% additional per hour.
- **Training plan accuracy** — V1 plans are rule-based (Daniels' formula), which is proven science but not personalised. If user outcome data shows the rules aren't enough, add a Python ML service later — the Go service architecture supports this cleanly.
- **Go service as single point of failure** — The Go service handles WebSockets, background jobs, AND premium features. Keep these as separate goroutine pools so a spike in one doesn't starve the others. Health check each independently.

## Anti-spam / moderation — what's shipped, what's deferred

Phases 1 and 2 landed as a tightening of the search + create paths;
phase 3 shipped the smallest-useful reporting surface. The bigger
admin-tooling work is intentionally deferred until the first real
spam wave forces the prioritisation.

### Shipped

- [x] **Search ranking by reputation** — clubs sort by member_count
  alongside geographic distance; people sort by `public_runs_count`
  before falling through to alphabetical. Migration
  `20260906_001_search_ranking_member_count.sql` adds the
  `clubs.member_count` denorm + maintenance trigger. Web wires it via
  `apps/web/src/lib/social/search_ranking.ts`. (Anti-spam phase 1)
- [x] **Soft create-rate-limits** on clubs (5/hour) and routes
  (30/hour). BEFORE INSERT triggers call `enforce_create_rate_limit`
  which reuses the existing `rate_limits` table + `check_rate_limit`
  RPC. service_role + null-auth (migrations, seed) + forged inserts
  (caught by RLS instead) all bypass. Migration
  `20260907_001_create_rate_limits.sql`. (Anti-spam phase 2)
- [x] **Send-rate-limits on direct messages** — the rail had no
  throttle at all until migration
  `20270608_001_direct_message_rate_limit.sql`; the INSERT policy's
  follow-graph + block gate was its entire anti-spam story. A BEFORE
  INSERT trigger on `direct_messages` debits two buckets through the
  same `enforce_create_rate_limit` helper: 30/minute bounds how fast
  messages arrive, 250/hour bounds how many. Table-level rather than
  per-affordance, so `/messages` and the route-send dialog are both
  covered by one mechanism ([decisions § 737](../architecture/decisions.md)).
- [x] **User-submitted reports** on profiles, clubs, routes. A
  `reports` table with polymorphic `(target_kind, target_id)` ref + a
  `submit_report` SECURITY DEFINER RPC that validates the target
  exists, rejects self-reports, rate-limits at 10/hour, and refuses
  duplicate pending reports via a partial-unique index. RLS hides
  others' reports from each user. Migration
  `20260908_001_user_reports.sql`. Web: `ReportDialog.svelte` mounted
  on `/u/[id]`, `/clubs/[slug]`, `/routes/[id]`. (Anti-spam phase 3)
- [x] **Admin role + moderation page.** `app_admins (user_id)` allow-list
  + a `private.is_admin(uid)` oracle (SECURITY DEFINER, `private` schema
  so it's not a PostgREST RPC oracle — mirrors the membership oracles)
  back four admin-gated RPCs (`am_i_admin`, `fetch_pending_reports`,
  `fetch_reports_for_target`, `resolve_target_reports`). Every report RPC
  hard-denies a non-admin with `42501` server-side — the real boundary,
  since the web SPA can't gate on the client. Web: `/admin/reports` queue
  (one row per reported target, newest-active first) → detail modal →
  triage (mark reviewed/dismissed + note). **Web-only** back-office tooling
  ([decisions §142](../architecture/decisions.md#142-admin-authorization-is-db-enforced-via-app_admins--a-privateis_admin-oracle-never-client-side-route-gating)). Triage-only — no content takedown in v1.
  Migration `20270104_001_admin_moderation.sql`.

### Deferred

- [x] **Auto-hide after N reports** from vetted reporters — shipped
  (backlog E1+E3, migration `20270218_001`). A SECURITY DEFINER
  `auto_hide_target()` invoked by an AFTER INSERT trigger on `reports`
  counts DISTINCT pending reporters with ≥ 5 public runs each and flips
  `clubs.shadow_hidden` / `routes.shadow_hidden` / `user_profiles.shadow_hidden`
  at ≥ 3, notifying the owner with a new `content_hidden` notification kind
  (once, on the false→true transition). Shadow-hidden targets drop out of
  every public/search/discovery surface (`public_routes` view,
  `discoverable_routes_in_bbox`, `search_clubs`, `clubs_in_bbox`,
  `public_profile_by_id`, `search_user_profiles`); the owner + admins still
  see their own row. Admins revert via the admin-gated `admin_unhide_target`
  RPC, surfaced as a Hidden badge + Unhide button on `/admin/reports`
  (`fetch_pending_reports` gained a `shadow_hidden` column). N = 3, M ≥ 5
  (E3 reputation gate). **CISO review was recommended for this moderation
  surface; the owner chose to proceed without it — see decisions.md §172.**
  pgtap + Playwright e2e. Comment/club_post/run reports never auto-hide
  (no shadow column; v1 takedown stays a manual admin step).
- [x] **Report buttons on more surfaces** — shipped (backlog E2,
  migration `20270115_001`). The MVP covered users / clubs / routes;
  this finalized `comment` as a first-class `ReportTargetKind` and
  added `club_post` + `run`. The `reports.target_kind` CHECK + the TS
  union now cover {user, club, route, comment, club_post, run} and are
  registered as a CHECK↔union guard pair; `submit_report` validates
  the new targets and rejects self-reports. Web: Report on each
  non-author club-feed post + on runs (run-detail + share-run).
  Mobile: report affordance on club posts + the public-run screen
  (byte-identical iOS twin). pgtap + e2e + widget tests.
- [x] **Reputation-weighted reports** — shipped with auto-hide (backlog
  E3, migration `20270218_001`). `auto_hide_target()` counts only
  reporters with ≥ 5 public runs (the same `is_public`-run gate
  `public_run_counts` uses), so a bot reporting from puppet accounts with
  no history doesn't trip the auto-hide. Verified in pgtap (a 2-vetted +
  1-unvetted set does NOT hide; the 3rd vetted reporter does).
- [x] **Friendly "slow down" toasts** for the create-rate-limit P0001
  errors — shipped (backlog E4). `data.ts` (createClub / saveRoute /
  importRoute) already rewraps the P0001 SQLSTATE into a friendly
  Error; the web create flows (ClubEditor, route builder, ImportRoute)
  now surface that via `showToast(..., 'error')` instead of an inline
  banner — bringing web to parity with mobile's `showTopBanner`.

## Competitor-parity backlog (unphased)

Generated from `docs/product/competitors.md` and confirmed scope with the user. These are the features that would close the gap to the strongest existing apps (Strava / Garmin / Nike Run Club / AllTrails / Runna / Komoot). They are **deliberately unphased** — ordering depends on three decisions the user still owes:

1. **Which competitor do we most want to displace first?** (Drives which bundle ships before the others — e.g. beating Runna means plan runner before segments; beating Strava means segments + social graph before plans.)
2. **Pricing model:** free forever / freemium / pay-once. Gates how much of the list sits behind a paywall.
3. **Premium boundary:** where the line runs between free and paid if freemium is chosen.

Until those three are answered, treat this list as a menu, not a sequence. Rough sizing is in weeks of single-dev work; most items carry schema changes that need the usual codegen + CI parity check (see `schema_codegen.md`). **Note (2026-06-03): this menu predates roughly half its items shipping** — rows now marked `[x]` shipped or partial were built ahead of the ordering decisions; the still-open rows are the real remaining menu.

| # | Feature | Rough size | Competitor it closes | Schema impact | Open decisions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Training plan runner** — [x] web: schema + generator + editor + dashboard card + auto-match; [x] Android: engine port + plans list + create wizard + plan/workout detail + today's-workout card on Run tab idle; [x] live structured-workout execution loop (shipped on Android — [workout_execution.md](../features/workout_execution.md)) | **shipped** (web + Android + execution loop) | Runna, Garmin | `training_plans`, `plan_weeks`, `plan_workouts` (shipped) | Resolved — reused the existing audio-cue layer + a band overlay on the run screen, zero schema impact. |
| 2 | **External integrations (OAuth sync)**: Strava read + write, Garmin Connect, Health Connect, HealthKit, parkrun, RunSignUp | 4–6 wk + Garmin business approval | Strava, Garmin | `integrations` already exists — extend per provider; token refresh Edge Function | Webhook vs polling for Strava; Garmin app approval timeline |
| 3 | **Segments + leaderboards** ([x] **shipped** — v1 route-anchored boards + v2 tiered (gender / age-band) leaderboards with KOM/QOM crowns; client-side auto-effort. See Phase-3 social section above.) | shipped | Strava | `segments`, `segment_efforts` (migrations `20260526_001`, `20260829_001`) | Resolved: route-anchored v1; arbitrary-geometry HMM matching still deferred |
| 4 | **Heatmap / popular-route discovery** ([x] v1 shipped — public-routes-only heatmap via PostGIS `heatmap_points_in_bbox` RPC on top of densified `routes.geom`; web overlay on `/routes?tab=heatmap` with a MapLibre `heatmap` paint layer; refreshes on map moveend with 350 ms debounce, 5k point cap. Privacy: route opt-in gates inclusion via `routes.is_public`, and since migration `20270504_001` the RPC also drops every densified point inside the route owner's privacy zones — the densified output IS the polyline resampled, so an unclipped reader handed anon the walk home (see decisions § 556). **[x] v2 shipped (web) — turned the blob into a route browser** laid out as a results sidebar beside a clean map (no more floating overlays stacking on each other or the map): a search + **Filters** popover holding the lens (`popular` / `friends` / `featured` / `hidden_gems` on `discoverable_routes_in_bbox`'s `p_filter` arg) and **multi-select race-distance bands** (5K / 10K / Half / Marathon / Ultra, combinable in any permutation, server-side via the parallel `p_dist_min[]`/`p_dist_max[]` bound arrays), MapLibre clustering on the route pins, a scrollable results list with per-route distance-band badges, the heat layer dimming as you zoom in, and **hover-to-preview** — route lines are hidden by default; hovering a dot or its list row reveals just that one route's line (cached, anti-flicker) with a synchronized highlight across the map + list. `friends` = public routes *created by* users you follow (there is no retained run↔route link to power "run by friends"); `hidden_gems` = un-run public routes past a 1 km sanity floor. **[x] Mobile parity shipped** — `routes_heatmap_screen.dart` (byte-identical twin) now has the same lens + race-distance band filters, pure-Dart pin clustering (no new dep), a results bottom sheet, and tap-to-preview (touch equivalent of hover); see [decisions § 102](../architecture/decisions.md).) | 2 wk | Strava, Komoot | Migrations `20260828_001_heatmap_points.sql`, `20261113_001_discoverable_routes_filter.sql`, `20261114_001_discoverable_routes_distance_bands.sql` | Resolved: opt-in (via existing `routes.is_public`) — no separate user-level toggle |
| 5 | **Trail / offline navigation** (turn-by-turn nav on a loaded route, offline tile packs, condition reports). [x] shipped — community **condition reports** (web canonical + mobile, migration `20270215_001`, privacy-redacting `route_conditions_for_viewer` RPC); **offline tile packs** (mobile, sibling on-disk cache hooked onto the offline pin, read-through live map, `decisions.md § 170`); **turn-by-turn voice cues** (mobile, geometric generator over the route polyline, `decisions.md § 169`); plus the earlier "Save for offline" per-route pin + phone → Wear OS DataLayer push of starred routes (`decisions.md § 64`). Routing-engine question resolved: self-contained geometric cue generator (no external engine), `decisions.md § 166`. **Prod gates:** condition reports are a privacy-boundary surface (run `/audit/privacy-zones`); offline tile packs need MapTiler-ToS sign-off for bulk tile persistence before prod (else use self-hosted Protomaps), `decisions.md § 167` | 3–4 wk | AllTrails, Komoot | `route_conditions` (user reports), tile-pack store on disk | Resolved: geometric generator (§169) |
| 6 | **Social graph** ([x] **shipped** — follow/unfollow + feed, kudos, threaded comments, privacy zones. See Phase-3 social section above.) | shipped | Strava, Nike Run Club | shipped as `user_follows`, `run_kudos`, `run_comments`, `user_settings.prefs.privacy_zones` (not the placeholder names in this row) | Resolved: public-by-default profiles; report surface shipped (see Anti-spam below) |
| 7 | **Gear tracking** ([x] shipped — `gear` + `run_gear` tables under migration `20260827_001_gear_tracking.sql`, RLS owner-scoped on gear and join-through-runs on assignments. `gear_with_distance` view aggregates per-item mileage. Web: `/settings/gear` tab with sub-tabs (shoes / bikes), retire/restore/delete, mileage bars with km/mi awareness. `RunGearChips.svelte` mounted on `/runs/[id]` with owner-only multi-select modal. Mobile (both twins): `GearScreen`, `gear_form_sheet.dart`, `run_gear_chips.dart`. **Per-shoe wear-pattern logging shipped** (migration `20270225_001_gear_wear_logs.sql`, `gear_wear_logs` table, owner-only RLS): dated qualitative wear observations (free-text note + optional outsole/midsole/upper/other area) per gear item, the qualitative companion to the distance-based `gear_wear` classifier. Web full CRUD inline on `/settings/gear`; mobile add/list/delete via the api from the gear edit form (online-only, like gear-backfill). **Multi-pair "rotation" tagging shipped** (migration `20270227_001_gear_rotations.sql`, `gear_rotations` + `gear_rotation_members` join, owner-only RLS with the run_gear double-gate; decisions §183): named many-to-many gear groupings ("Daily trainers", "Race day") — distinct from and additive to the single `is_default` current pair (a rotation never changes auto-tagging). Web: manage rotations + member-checkbox modal + group-by-rotation filter on `/settings/gear`. Mobile (both twins): `GearRotationsScreen` reached from the gear AppBar, online-only via the api (outside `LocalGearStore`, like gear-backfill). **Rotation next-up shipped web + mobile** (`gear/rotation_pick.ts` ↔ `gear_rotation_pick.dart`, a registered TS↔Dart parity pair): a rotation row names the member with the most life left — least share of its own replacement target, worn pairs ranked last, retired pairs dropped, untracked pairs measured against the rotation's median target — and offers a one-click handoff of the `is_default` star to it. A rotation still changes nothing about auto-tagging on its own; this is the explicit bridge between the two, without which a runner rotating three pairs banked every kilometre on whichever pair last held the star. Mobile (both twins): the same read-out + Make-current action on `GearRotationsScreen`, over the new `ApiClient.setDefaultGear`, computed once per gear kind the rotation holds because the star is scoped to `(owner, kind)`. **Post-create gear backfill reached web** (decisions §598): `GearBackfillModal` + the `gear_backfill.ts` ↔ `gear_backfill.dart` parity pair + the additive `addGearToRuns` write, so registering a pair you've already been running in no longer starts its mileage at zero — previously Android-only, an inversion of the web-canonical rule. Future: barcode import.) | 1 wk | Strava, Garmin | `gear` + `run_gear` + `gear_wear_logs` + `gear_rotations` | Resolved: manual entry for v1 |
| 8 | **Photos on runs, routes, and clubs** ([x] **runs shipped** — `run_photos` + `run-photos` bucket + server-side EXIF strip + 512w thumbnail worker; [x] **route photos shipped** — `route_photos` + private `route-photos` bucket, web + android (+ iOS twin), client-side EXIF strip, backlog C1; [x] **route server-side thumbnails + EXIF worker shipped** — `route_photo_process` job kind + enqueue triggers, migration `20270224_001`; clients already prefer the thumbnail; [x] **club photos shipped** — `club_photos` + private `club-photos` bucket + `club_photo_process` EXIF/thumbnail worker, web + android (+ iOS twin), member-upload / owner-or-admin-delete gallery, migration `20270301_001`, decisions §184) | done | Strava, AllTrails | `run_photos` / `route_photos` / `club_photos` (buckets `run-photos` / `route-photos` / `club-photos`) shipped — migrations `20260525_001` / `20270114_001` / `20270224_001` / `20270301_001` | Deferred: club-photo gallery moderation tooling (basic owner/admin delete ships) |
| 9 | **Audio-coached / guided runs** ([x] **shipped** — TTS-narrated scripted workouts. `lib/training/guided_runs.ts` (web, parity twin `apps/mobile_android/lib/guided_runs.dart` — a **registered** pair in both registries since 2026-08-30, and guarded across the two rails by `check_shared_constants.mjs`, [decisions § 801](../architecture/decisions.md)) holds the cue library; web `/guided` + `/guided/[id]` are a preview surface (web doesn't record). **The recording integration landed 2026-08-30** ([decisions § 802](../architecture/decisions.md)): a guided run is armed from the Run tab's idle pre-run options row and spoken by an L4 block on the recorder tick through `cuesDue` + `AudioCues.announceGuidedCue` — the QUEUEING TTS path, distinct from the interrupting `speakGuidedCue` the library preview keeps — gated by its own `guided_run` voice-cue toggle, stamped as the owner-only `runs.metadata.guided_run_id`, and mirrored to the custom watch's `SET1` slot behind the § 71 loopback gate. **Between 2026-06 and that date this row claimed mobile "speaks the cues via `audio_cues.dart` during a recording", which was never true**: `cuesDue` had no production caller, `run_screen.dart` contained no occurrence of "guided", and the mobile screen's own doc comment called the L0–L4 integration a follow-up. TTS-only v1 — no pre-recorded voice talent.) | shipped (web preview + mobile TTS + recorder integration) | Nike Run Club | none (scripted library in code; `metadata.guided_run_id` owner-only via `20270627000001`) | Resolved: TTS-only v1, no audio CDN |
| 10 | **Race calendar + results import** (event discovery near me, entry links, auto-match results when you record the race) | 2 wk | Garmin, Runna | `races`, `race_results`; import from RunSignUp + parkrun | Scope: local only or worldwide? |
| 11 | **Advanced analytics** ([x] **shipped** — VDOT/VO₂, training-load fitness/fatigue/form curves, race-time predictor, weekly/monthly breakdowns. **Analytics-polish remainder shipped (web):** an **Easy / hard balance** card (`IntensityBalanceCard.svelte` — time-weighted 80/20 split + verdict from `lib/training/intensity.ts`, VDOT-threshold classifier) and **week-over-week / month-over-month trend deltas** on distance / time / runs (`TrendDeltasCard.svelte` — period-to-date vs prior period-to-date from `lib/training/trend_deltas.ts`), both self-hiding on data presence, scoped to the source filter + `week_start_day`. See Phase-3 "Premium tier" + "Competitor-parity" sections above.) | shipped | Garmin, Runna | `fitness_snapshots` + derived from `runs` | Resolved: Daniels (VDOT) + Banister-style EWMA load |
| 12 | **Premium billing + feature gating** (Stripe Checkout, subscription webhook, `SubscriptionTier` honouring across web + mobile, customer portal) | 1–2 wk | All | `user_profiles.subscription_tier` already exists; add `stripe_customer_id`, `stripe_subscription_id` | Monthly vs annual; grandfather early users? |
| 13 | **Treadmill (BLE FTMS)** ([x] **mobile — backlog C3** — FTMS `0x1826` / `0x2ACD` reader + `TreadmillSample` stream (`ble_treadmill.dart`), Settings → Integrations pairing tile, an additive opt-in distance seam in `run_recorder` (belt overrides GPS only in treadmill mode; GPS L0/L1 path untouched; writes `metadata.indoor_source='treadmill'`), and the **live run-screen mode toggle** (`run_screen.dart` `_toggleTreadmillMode`, gated on a paired belt, L4 opt-in — belt is the app-owned `BleTreadmill` singleton mirroring the HR strap)) — real-time speed / distance / incline from a paired treadmill. Mobile-only (web is not a recording surface). Spec + scope: [integrations.md § Treadmills (BLE FTMS)](../features/integrations.md#treadmills-ble-ftms), toggle plan: [treadmill_live_mode.md](../features/treadmill_live_mode.md). | Shipped (mobile) | Garmin, Runna (indoor) | None — `prefs.treadmill_device` + `metadata.indoor_source = "treadmill"` | FTMS covers ~60 % of treadmills; Peloton / NordicTrack / Echelon need per-vendor work. Punt or scope per-brand follow-ups when v1 ships. |

### Planned features — specced 2026-06-15

Ten features were specced into full implementation-handoff plans under [docs/features/](../features/) (each: what exists to build on → migrations + codegen → web-canonical surface → mobile twin → parity helpers → tests → i18n → docs → gating → numbered build order). **All ten have since been built** — nine outright, and native push code-complete behind its credential gate. The per-item notes below carry what actually landed; the plan docs themselves now read as design records rather than to-do lists.

- [x] **Challenges & competitions** — [challenges.md](../features/challenges.md). **Shipped web + mobile 2026-06-19** (migrations `20270209_001` + `20270210_001`; **vert metric added 2026-06-20, migration `20270302_001`, ADR §186**). Monthly/weekly mileage·time·**elevation (vert)**·activity-count·streak challenges; individual / club-vs-club / group-goal; read-time leaderboard via a single GROUP-BY RPC (no N+1); self-hiding strip on dashboard + `/social` tab + mobile Social sub-tab; completion badge + notification via opportunistic RPC + daily cron sweep. **On-pace hint added 2026-07-01, ADR §192** (`challengePace` — ahead/on-track/behind verdict + daily rate to finish on the progress bar, web + mobile). No compliance gate. *Flagship engagement bet.*
- [x] **Multi-athlete coach view** — [coach_roster.md](../features/coach_roster.md). Coach roster dashboard on the existing `coach_athletes` consent model + a fail-closed SECURITY DEFINER roster RPC (`coach_roster_summary`, migration `20270206_001`): 7-day load, plan %, ACWR injury-risk, recency. Shipped web (`/coaching` roster table) + mobile (`coaching_screen` roster card); the ACWR risk policy lives in the shared `coach_load` parity helper, track stays owner-only.
- [x] **Achievements / badges** — [achievements.md](../features/achievements.md). **Web shipped 2026-06-19** (migration `20270208_001`): badge catalogue as code (guided-runs pattern), full-rebuild SECURITY DEFINER trigger mirroring `personal_records`, `achievements` table; profile Achievements tab + feed badge strip + public `/share/badge/[id]` page + OG card + `share-badge` Lambda; `'achievement'` notification kind. **Mobile read surface shipped 2026-06-20**: the `badges.ts`↔`badges.dart` parity pair, `BadgeGrid` widget, Achievements tab on `ProfileScreen` + recent-badge strip on `FeedScreen`, `fetchUserBadges`/`fetchFollowingBadgeAwards` api_client methods + the `BadgeAwardEntry` model, ARBs across all six locales, iOS byte-identical twin. Owner visibility-toggle + share-page stay web-only. Pairs with Challenges.
- [x] **Fundraising / donation pages** — [fundraising.md](../features/fundraising.md) (shipped web + mobile-read 2026-06-19, migration `20270213_001`, ADR §167). Charity page (thermometer + donation feed) on a run/event, reusing the paid-events Stripe Connect rail. **Prod-gated**: fail-closed behind live Stripe keys + owner/CISO/counsel sign-off — the full code path is built + test-mode-verified; going live is a pre-deploy checklist, not unwritten code.
- [x] **Race calendar + results import** — [race_calendar.md](../features/race_calendar.md) (shipped 2026-06-20, migration `20270214_001`). *Supersedes backlog row #10.* Discover races near me + entry links (web `/races` + mobile `RacesScreen`) + auto-match-on-record (inform-tier prompt on run-detail, both platforms) + manual paste import + crowd-submitted listings. parkrun shipped; **RunSignUp + UltraSignup + ChronoTrack legs built fail-closed behind their own missing credential pairs** — RunSignUp (`RUNSIGNUP_API_KEY`), UltraSignup (`ULTRASIGNUP_API_KEY` / `ULTRASIGNUP_API_SECRET`, decisions §185), and ChronoTrack Live (`CHRONOTRACK_CLIENT_ID` / `CHRONOTRACK_USER_ID` / `CHRONOTRACK_PASSWORD`, all three required, 2026-06-20); each returns 503 `provider_not_configured` per provider and the Settings integrations card shows the unavailable explainer. **"Provisioning each credential is the only remaining go-live step" was false in three ways until 2026-08-30** ([decisions § 806](../architecture/decisions.md)). (a) Both clients' import UI branched on `runsignup` alone, so a ChronoTrack or UltraSignup listing fell through to manual paste and the built leg was unreachable — provisioning `CHRONOTRACK_*` would have lit up a Settings card linking to a page that could not use it. (b) UltraSignup did not exist on the phone at all: absent from the provider union, no probe, no Settings tile, zero ARB keys, against a full web surface in seven catalogues. (c) **`race-listings-sync` is a stub** — it validates credentials and returns `{ synced: 0 }`, so even fully provisioned no RunSignUp or UltraSignup race ever enters the calendar; today's listings are parkrun, crowd submissions and hand inserts. (a) and (b) are closed: both platforms now render every built leg from one provider catalogue, each with its own scope field and its own unavailable explainer, guarded against the Edge Function's own dispatch set. **(c) is the real remaining work and it is not a credential gate** — the upcoming-races fetch + upsert is unwritten, and writing a parser against a response shape we cannot observe without a key is the same fragility the per-site scrapers were deferred for. RaceResult per-site scraper likewise deferred.
- [x] **Year-in-review / "Wrapped" gap-closers** — [year_in_review.md](../features/year_in_review.md) + [recap.md](../features/recap.md) (shipped 2026-06-19, migration `20270207_001`). The annual recap was already shipped; this closed the gaps: a public OG-unfurlable share snapshot (`public_recaps` table — opt-in, fail-closed-private, revocable; `/recap/share/[id]` + `/og/recap/[id].png` web routes + the `share-recap` prod Lambda), a **monthly** variant (`/recap/[year]/[month]` reusing `buildMonthInRunningRecap`), the extracted shared `RecapView.svelte`, and the `recap.ts`↔`recap.dart` parity pair registered + the prior Dart drift (badges / elevation / extras) closed. Mobile gained a "Publish & share link" action. **Infra wiring landed** (2026-06-20, mirrors the `share-run`/`share-route` Lambda wiring): the `share-recap` CloudFront origin + `/recap/share/*` + `/og/recap/*` behaviours + cache/origin-request policies + the Lambda function/alias/URL/OAC/permission in `infra/modules/web-stack/`, the prod+preview GitHub-OIDC `lambda:UpdateFunctionCode` resource grant in `infra/github-oidc/`, and the bundle+update steps in `.github/workflows/release-web.yml`. `terraform validate` passes on both env stacks. **Remaining operator step:** `terraform apply` in `infra/envs/{preview,prod}` (creates the Lambda + CloudFront behaviours) then push a `web@*` tag so `release-web.yml` ships the real `share-recap.zip` over the placeholder — no AWS creds were available here to apply. **Mobile monthly recap shipped 2026-08-03** (both twins): `RecapScreen` gained a Year / Month toggle over the already-shipped `buildMonthInRunningRecap`, so web's two routes are one screen on the phone; publishing a month upserts the same `period_kind='month'` / `period_key='YYYY-MM'` row the web month page does.
- [~] **Native push (FCM/APNs)** — [native_push.md](../features/native_push.md) — **BUILT 2026-06-19, gated on credentials** ([`followups.md`](followups.md) → **Native push delivery**) (migration `20270212_001`). *Same as the Phase 4b "native push" bullet.* Third consumer of the `notifications` rows copying the shipped `web_push` sibling + mobile token registration — all credential-independent code shipped fail-closed. Going live blocked only on user-supplied Firebase/APNs credentials.
- [x] **Treadmill live-mode toggle** — [treadmill_live_mode.md](../features/treadmill_live_mode.md). *Closes the deferred piece of backlog row #13.* Shipped mobile-only: a paired-belt-gated run-screen toggle (`_toggleTreadmillMode`) against the already-shipped FTMS reader + recorder seam; no recorder/schema change. `BleTreadmill` is now an app-owned singleton (paired in Settings, read by the run screen), mirroring the HR strap.
- [x] **Turn-by-turn offline nav + condition reports** — [trail_navigation.md](../features/trail_navigation.md). *Advances backlog row #5.* Shipped: `route_conditions` reports (web + mobile, migration `20270215_001`), offline tile-pack store (mobile, `decisions.md § 170`), turn-cue voice cues (mobile, `turn_cues` parity helper, `decisions.md § 169`). Routing engine resolved: self-contained geometric generator (no external engine). Prod gates: `/audit/privacy-zones` on the conditions surface + MapTiler-ToS sign-off for offline tile persistence.
- [x] **Public "Learn" / guides pages** — [learn.md](../features/learn.md) (specced in [learn_pages.md](../features/learn_pages.md)). **Shipped web** (2026-06-19): `/learn` hub + `/learn/<slug>` articles + `/learn/category/<id>`, eight evergreen new-runner guides as prerendered MDsvex content, full SEO (canonical / Open Graph / `Article` JSON-LD) mirroring `/share/*`, sitemap inclusion, and a contextual in-app CTA per guide. Web-only (no twin), shell-less + anon. The "your first race" guide's CTA uses the interim `/social?tab=clubs` pending a race calendar. **Prose-localization mechanism shipped** (2026-06-20): a `<slug>.<locale>.md` per-locale lookup with field-by-field English fallback drives the article body, the article H1, and the hub/category card title + description (via `localizedGuideMeta`), so a non-English visitor reads a localized listing AND body where a translation exists and the English source + "this guide is in English" notice where it does not; the English body still prerenders into the static HTML (canonical), localized component lazy-resolved client-side. **Prose localization complete** (2026-06-20): all eight guides are translated into all six locales (`en` source + `de/fr/es/ja/pt-BR`); the field-by-field English fallback stays wired for any future guide added before its translations land.

**Cross-cutting notes (kept as the record — all ten have landed):** (1) migration numbers in the plans were placeholders, assigned sequentially at landing; (2) the Learn "first race" guide and Year-in-review favourite-route card both wanted race-calendar links and shipped against the interim `/social?tab=clubs` — **the race calendar has since shipped at `/races`, so the Learn `racing` CTA repoint is still owed**, see [learn.md § Race-calendar dependency](../features/learn.md); (3) Year-in-review and Treadmill were gap-closers, not greenfield; (4) Fundraising / Native push / race_calendar's RunSignUp leg are *prod-gated, not code-blocked* — each is built behind its fail-closed gate per the compliance-sign-off house rule.

**Order actually taken:** Challenges → Achievements → Learn pages → Coach view → Year-in-review + Treadmill → Race calendar → Native push (code) / Fundraising / Trail nav.

### Where each item lives in the repo

For whichever items the user green-lights, here's where the new surface lands — so future sessions can pick one up without re-deriving the map:

- **Web pages:** `apps/web/src/routes/<feature>/+page.svelte` + the data helpers in `src/lib/core/data.ts` (add a new section header). New types overlay in `src/lib/types.ts`.
- **Mobile Android:** `apps/mobile_android/lib/screens/<feature>_screen.dart` + a service singleton in `apps/mobile_android/lib/<feature>_service.dart` if there's non-trivial network state. Tab additions in `home_screen.dart`; 6 tabs is the current ceiling — past that, collapse under an existing tab.
- **Backend:** one migration per feature under `apps/backend/supabase/migrations/` with the same naming pattern (`YYYYMMDD_NNN_<feature>.sql`). Run `npm run gen:types && dart run scripts/gen_dart_models.dart` after each, commit both.
- **Edge Functions** for OAuth exchanges / webhooks: `apps/backend/supabase/functions/<provider>-<action>/index.ts`. One function per provider action (e.g. `strava-webhook`, `garmin-import`).
- **Decisions** for any non-obvious trade-off: append to `docs/architecture/decisions.md` in sequence (next free number is #11).
- **Feature doc stub** in `docs/product/features.md` under a "Competitor-parity features" section (stubs added below, flesh out on delivery).
- **Tests** — see `docs/testing/testing.md` for the per-feature-area test map.
