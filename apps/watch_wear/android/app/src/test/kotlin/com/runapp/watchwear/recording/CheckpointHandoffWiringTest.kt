/// Source-level guard on who clears the in-progress checkpoint, and when.
///
/// The checkpoint is the run's only durable record between the service
/// publishing `Finished` and `LocalRunStore` accepting the queue entry. The
/// service used to clear it inside its own teardown, concurrently with that
/// write and immediately before dropping out of foreground-service state —
/// so a process kill in the window erased both the queue entry and the
/// snapshot that would have rebuilt it, and the run was simply gone.
///
/// The clear now belongs to the writer: `RunViewModel.handleFinishedRun`
/// clears only after `store.save` returns. The worst case flips from losing
/// the run to a checkpoint outliving a banked one, which `recoveryActionFor`
/// grades `Discard` — silently, no phantom "Recover unsaved run?" prompt.
///
/// Service lifecycle and the ViewModel are both Android-bound and not
/// host-JVM testable without Robolectric, so the ordering is pinned with a
/// source grep per the module's convention (see `CheckpointRecoveryWiringTest`).
