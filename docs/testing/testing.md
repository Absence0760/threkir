## TL;DR

```bash
# Run every Dart test in the workspace (Melos 7 — see CLAUDE.md gotcha:
# the `melos run` script lookup is broken; use `melos exec` instead).
melos exec --scope="run_recorder" --scope="mobile_android" --scope="api_client" --scope="gpx_parser" --scope="ui_kit" --scope="core_models" -- flutter test
# (CI runs exactly these six scopes — see "Which runner" below.)

# Run one package's tests
cd apps/mobile_android && flutter test
cd packages/run_recorder && flutter test

# Run one file
flutter test test/run_stats_test.dart

# Run one group / test by name (substring match)
flutter test --plain-name "movingTimeOf"
flutter test --plain-name "speed clamp drops teleport-style jumps"

# Or regex match
flutter test --name "^position filter chain"

# Web (TypeScript) tests — from apps/web
npx tsx --test src/lib/training.test.ts

# Web e2e (Playwright) — from apps/web. Requires local Supabase
# running with seed.sql applied: cd apps/backend && supabase db reset.
pnpm test:e2e          # headless run
pnpm test:e2e:ui       # interactive picker
```

**Playwright and a dev server you did not start.** `playwright.config.ts` sets `reuseExistingServer: !CI`, so a `vite dev` left on `:7777` by another checkout is adopted silently and serves *its* bundle. The symptoms are a spec for a brand-new surface failing with no console error while every pre-existing spec passes, or — when that foreign server dies mid-suite — a wave of `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` failures indistinguishable from real breaks. `globalSetup` refuses to sign anyone in against a bundle that is not this tree's ([decisions § 697](../architecture/decisions.md)). It asks Vite for a source file's bytes through `?raw` twice — once by absolute path (`/@fs/…`, ours byte for byte) and once at the same path relative to the server's own root (whatever tree it is serving) — over this tree's own uncommitted `apps/web/src` files, falling back to a fixed module on a clean tree. Either answer disagreeing with disk fails the run naming the file; a `403` on the absolute path fails with the older, coarser reason (the server's `fs.allow` excludes us, so it is rooted elsewhere). Anything inconclusive — a 404 on both routes, a non-Vite server, an unreachable port — only warns, so an unfamiliar local setup is never turned into a failing suite. Kill the stray server (or run the suite from the checkout that owns it).

**Running the suite on a second port.** `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` moves the whole sharded lane — the vite port the config boots, the readiness probe and `use.baseURL` all come off it — so `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:7801 pnpm test:e2e` gets you past a `:7777` another checkout owns without killing it. It did not work before [decisions § 743](../architecture/decisions.md): the config pinned its `webServer` to `pnpm run dev` (which is `vite dev --port 7777`), and 32 sites under `tests-e2e` named `http://localhost:7777` outright, five of them as the `origin` of a clipboard `grantPermissions` — a grant on the wrong origin makes `navigator.clipboard.writeText` reject, so the recap specs failed in the catch branch they exist to prove is not taken. No spec names an origin any more: a relative `page.goto` / `request.get` resolves against the lane's `baseURL`, and the two APIs that need an absolute one take it from the `baseURL` fixture through `originOf()` in `tests-e2e/fixtures/base-url.ts`. A third harness guard, `tests-e2e/fixtures/base-url.test.ts`, fails on any literal dev-server origin outside that module and the lane configs, on a second reader of `process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`, and on two lanes binding the same port. The other three lanes pin their own: livehub `:7778`, exporthub `:7779`, sso `:7780`.

The guard is itself unit-tested (`tests-e2e/fixtures/dev_server_guard.test.ts`). Every Playwright config ignores `**/fixtures/**`, so harness guards under `tests-e2e/fixtures/` run in the **web unit** suite instead — `npx tsx --test 'src/**/*.test.ts' 'tests-e2e/fixtures/**/*.test.ts'` from `apps/web`.

**Type-checking the specs.** `tsx` and Playwright's esbuild transpile both *strip* types rather than check them, and `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json` includes `src/` / `test/` / `tests/` only — so until [decisions § 749](../architecture/decisions.md) nothing typechecked `tests-e2e/` at all and ten errors had accumulated there. `npm run check:e2e-types --workspace=apps/web` runs `tsc` over the tree through `apps/web/tsconfig.tests-e2e.json` (a second root, deliberately not a widened `include` on `tsconfig.json`), and CI runs it as the `Playwright tree typecheck` step of `parity-types`. Run it alongside `npm run check` after touching a spec or a fixture; `tests-e2e/fixtures/tsconfig-coverage.test.ts` fails if a compilable file appears under `tests-e2e/` that the config's include list does not reach.

**Type-checking everything else under `apps/web`.** The same hole ran three trees deeper ([decisions § 752](../architecture/decisions.md)): `scripts/`, `lambda/` (eight production AWS handlers), `svelte.config.js` and `static/sw.js` were in no `tsc` program either. `npm run check:node-types --workspace=apps/web` covers the first three through `tsconfig.node.json`; `npm run check:sw-types --workspace=apps/web` covers the service worker through `tsconfig.service-worker.json`, which is separate because a service worker's globals come from the `WebWorker` lib and that cannot share a program with `DOM`. CI runs both as the `Node + service-worker tree typecheck` step of `parity-types`, alongside `npm run test:tsconfig-coverage --workspace=apps/web` — a guard that names no tree at all: it reads every `tsconfig*.json` at the top of `apps/web`, follows each `extends` chain to whichever config declares `include` (so SvelteKit's generated one is read rather than transcribed), and fails when a compilable file git reports under `apps/web` matches none of them. Adding a directory of scripts to `apps/web` therefore fails that guard until it is put inside a root.

**A seeded day belongs to the browser's zone, not the runner's.** `playwright.config.ts` pins every browser context to `timezoneId: 'UTC'`, so a page that buckets rows into "today" resolves that day in UTC while the Node process building the seed sits in the workstation's zone. Build a day-relative timestamp with `new Date(y, m, d, h, 0)` and it lands on the adjacent calendar day whenever the two disagree — sixteen hours a day in EDT it is fine, and the other eight the row vanishes and a visibility assertion fails on a timeout that explains nothing. Hosted runners are UTC, so CI never sees it. Every day-relative seed goes through `tests-e2e/fixtures/dates.ts` — `browserDate` (a `YYYY-MM-DD` day key), `browserDateOf` (the day an instant the app wrote falls on), `browserDayStart` (the `gte` bound of a day window), `browserDayAt` / `noonOnBrowserDay` (a `started_at`), and `waterStorageKey` (the nutrition water tracker's per-day localStorage key, composed from the page's own `waterDayKey`). The second harness guard, `tests-e2e/fixtures/dates.test.ts`, scans every `.ts` under `tests-e2e/` and fails on a local-zone date getter or setter, with a reasoned allowlist for the sites that are zone-neutral or not yet converted; it also fails if the config stops pinning UTC. It has to be a source scan — the defect is invisible to any run whose two zones happen to agree that hour, so no assertion inside a spec can catch it. See [decisions.md § 728](../architecture/decisions.md).

**A backend cross-check must be able to say whether it looked.** A spec's service-role assertion stacks two claims — that the read reached the database, and that what came back is what the feature should have written. `const { data } = await admin.from(...)` collapses them: the error is discarded and the absence becomes a value the `expect` then judges the feature on. Against a non-zero expectation that blames the feature for a read that never ran (`Expected: 6000, Received: 0` reads exactly like a broken derived cache); against a zero, empty or null one **the assertion passes** and the cross-check stops testing anything — which is how thirty RLS negatives and the Art 17 cascade checks stayed green while vouching for nothing. Every backend read behind an assertion goes through `tests-e2e/fixtures/db-read.ts` — `readRow` (the row must exist), `readMaybeRow` (its absence is the thing under test), `readRows`, `readCount` (a `head: true` probe) — so the read either produces rows or throws naming itself. A further harness guard, `tests-e2e/fixtures/db-read.test.ts`, scans every `.ts` under `tests-e2e/` and fails when a binding from a read whose `error` is never consulted appears inside an `expect(...)` at all. It bans the shape rather than a list of absorbers on purpose: the first version enumerated them, and a bare `?.`, a `!`, a cast and the read's own `null` all walked straight past it. See [decisions.md § 777](../architecture/decisions.md).

`flutter test` has no built-in `--watch` flag. For a tight edit-save-test loop, either rerun the single file manually (sub-second) or wire up an editor integration — the Flutter plugin for VS Code and Android Studio both support running individual tests from gutter icons and auto-re-running on save.

**When to run:**

- **While editing the file you're testing** — run that one test file (`flutter test test/foo_test.dart`). Sub-second feedback loop.
- **Before committing** — `melos exec --scope="run_recorder" --scope="mobile_android" --scope="api_client" --scope="gpx_parser" --scope="ui_kit" --scope="core_models" -- flutter test` across the workspace. Catches cross-package breakage.
- **Before pushing a PR** — `melos exec -- dart analyze && melos exec --scope="run_recorder" --scope="mobile_android" --scope="api_client" --scope="gpx_parser" --scope="ui_kit" --scope="core_models" -- flutter test`. Both must pass.
- **In CI** — both commands run automatically (see [architecture.md — CI/CD](../architecture/architecture.md#cicd-pipeline)).

## Which runner a package takes

**Three of the seven Dart packages cannot be run with `dart test` at all, and
the failure does not say so.** Every test file that imports `package:api_client/api_client.dart`,
`package:run_recorder/…` or `package:ui_kit/…` crashes the front-end compiler
before a single case runs:

```
Unhandled exception:
Crash when compiling:
type 'InvalidType' is not a subtype of type 'FunctionType' in type cast

#0      _FfiUseSiteTransformer._verifyAndReplaceNativeCallable (package:vm/modular/transformations/ffi/use_sites.dart:1317)
```

That is the Dart VM's FFI transformer meeting the Flutter SDK, which `dart test`
cannot compile against. It names no package, no dependency and no runner, so at
a workstation it reads as a broken tree rather than as the wrong command — and
`run_recorder` and `ui_kit` at least *declare* `flutter: sdk: flutter` in their
own `pubspec.yaml`, where **`api_client` does not**: it reaches the Flutter SDK
transitively through `supabase_flutter`, so its pubspec looks like a pure-Dart
package and its suite is the one that costs a session a run to diagnose.

There is no fix on our side — a package that depends on the Flutter SDK is a
`flutter test` package, and `api_client` depends on it through the only
Supabase client that exists for Flutter. So the runner is documented instead,
and `packages/api_client/test/test_runner_test.dart` fails the build when this
table stops matching the tree or the CI job:

| Package | Runner | Run in CI by |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/core_models` | `dart test` or `flutter test` | `test-packages` |
| `packages/gpx_parser` | `dart test` or `flutter test` | `test-packages` |
| `packages/api_client` | `flutter test` only | `test-packages` |
| `packages/run_recorder` | `flutter test` only | `test-packages` |
| `packages/ui_kit` | `flutter test` only | `test-packages` |
| `apps/mobile_android` | `flutter test` only | `test-packages` |
| `apps/mobile_ios` | `flutter test` only | nothing — byte-identical twin |

`apps/mobile_ios` is deliberately absent from the CI scope list: `twin-parity`
proves its `lib/` and `test/` are byte-identical to `apps/mobile_android`'s
([decisions § 39](../architecture/decisions.md#39-mobile_android-and-mobile_ios-share-a-byte-for-byte-dart-codebase)),
so compiling the same files a second time buys a second Flutter build and no
coverage. Measured 2026-09-08: `dart test` passes 204 cases in `core_models`
and 60 in `gpx_parser`, and crashes as above in the other three packages.

## What's covered today

Total: **~3,000 unique Dart mobile tests across ~263 test files, executed by both mobile targets** (mobile_android and mobile_ios share a byte-for-byte identical Dart codebase — see the iOS / android `CLAUDE.md` files), plus the run_recorder / api_client (~130 tests across 13 files) / core_models package suites, **~1,950 TypeScript unit tests across ~163 files** in the web app, ~1,130 Playwright e2e tests across ~229 spec files that drive the real web app against a local Supabase, **717 Wear OS Kotlin/JUnit tests across 70 files** (measured 2026-09-03), and **~1,140 pgTAP assertions across 147 SQL files** against the Postgres schema (49 of them `rls_*.sql`, carrying ~390 of those assertions; the rest cover rate-limits, job kinds, reports, segment-leaderboard tiers, and the personal-records cache — brackets / DNF / embedded-best / mile logic plus the trigger-maintained, trigger-only-write cache invariants), plus **809 Deno test cases across 56 files** next to the Edge Functions (785 run without a live stack; 23 more are the `SUPABASE_TEST_URL`-gated handler-envelope cases, and the 24th ignored case is a placeholder with an empty body so `deno test` prints an ignored case rather than "no tests" when the var is unset). Both mobile apps hold the same test files, but CI compiles them once: `test-packages` scopes `mobile_android` and not `mobile_ios`, and `twin-parity` is what vouches for the other target. **`apps/watch_ios` carries ~141 XCTest methods across 14 files** in `WatchAppTests/` (run formatting, complication formatter, active-run bridge, checkpoint codable + the streaming track store — chunk-boundary walk, truncated-vs-whole final line, file lifetime — workout-manager streaming track JSON + recovery + distance, transfer state, route-navigator off-route geometry + hysteresis, and `WatchRunPayloadFixtureTests` — the Swift side of the cross-platform watch-payload fixture loop, which reads the same `fixtures/watch_run_payload.json` as the Wear OS / mobile / web tests, so drift is now caught on watchOS too). They run in CI via the `test-watch-ios` job (`xcodebuild test` on a macOS runner against the shared `WatchApp` scheme), added 2026-06-16. `recording_integration_test.dart` covers the data-pipeline golden path (GPS → recorder → LocalRunStore → SyncService → API) and `run_screen_recording_flow_test.dart` drives the corresponding UI flow (tap START → countdown → recording state with LiveRunMap mounted → Finish hold → run saved via `runStore.save`). No `integration_test`-package tests (device-instrumented) yet, no golden tests. Counts here are point-in-time — they drift fast. Run `grep -cE '^\s*(test|testWidgets)\(' apps/mobile_android/test/*.dart` for the live per-target count and `diff -rq apps/mobile_android/test apps/mobile_ios/test` to confirm the trees stay in lockstep.

Test files use **relative imports** (`import '../lib/widgets/run_photos.dart'`) instead of `package:mobile_android/...` so the same file resolves on both targets — both apps' pubspecs differ only in `name`, and the Dart analyzer would reject `package:mobile_android/...` when building the iOS target.

The exhaustive, file-by-file inventory of what every test file covers (plus the Playwright spec layout and the log of production bugs the suite caught) lives in **[test_inventory.md](test_inventory.md)** — it drifts fast, so it's split out of this durable guide.


## Patterns

Six patterns show up across the suite. Adopt them when adding new tests so the style stays consistent.

### 1. `@visibleForTesting` hooks for untestable subsystems

`RunRecorder` opens a real geolocator stream in `prepare()`, which requires platform channels and can't run in `flutter test` without a mock. Instead of mocking the geolocator, we expose test-only entry points on the class itself:

```dart
@visibleForTesting
void debugPrepareWithoutStream({...});

@visibleForTesting
void debugInjectPosition(Position pos) => _onPosition(pos);

@visibleForTesting
List<Waypoint> get debugTrack => List.unmodifiable(_track);

@visibleForTesting
double get debugDistanceMetres => _distanceMetres;

@visibleForTesting
Duration get debugElapsed => _stopwatch.elapsed;

@visibleForTesting
Waypoint? get debugCurrentWaypoint => _currentWaypoint;
```

Tests construct a bare `RunRecorder`, call `debugPrepareWithoutStream(...)` with whatever filter params they need, call `debugInjectPosition(pos)` to feed the same `_onPosition` pipeline the live stream would, then assert on `debugTrack`, `debugDistanceMetres`, `debugElapsed`, etc.

The `@visibleForTesting` annotation (`package:flutter/foundation.dart`) doesn't hide the members at runtime — it just makes the analyzer warn if anything outside of tests calls them. That's exactly the boundary we want.

**When to use**: any class that wraps a platform-channel plugin (geolocator, pedometer, path_provider, permission_handler). Exposing a hook is usually cheaper than mocking the plugin.

### 2. Dependency injection for filesystem / path_provider

`LocalRunStore.init` takes an optional `Directory? overrideDirectory`:

```dart
Future<void> init({Directory? overrideDirectory}) async {
  if (overrideDirectory != null) {
    _dir = overrideDirectory;
  } else {
    final appDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    _dir = Directory('${appDir.path}/runs');
  }
  ...
}
```

Tests use a `setUp` / `tearDown` pair with `Directory.systemTemp.createTempSync(...)`:

```dart
late Directory tempDir;

setUp(() {
  tempDir = Directory.systemTemp.createTempSync('local_run_store_test_');
});

tearDown(() {
  if (tempDir.existsSync()) tempDir.deleteSync(recursive: true);
});

test('round-trip', () async {
  final store = LocalRunStore();
  await store.init(overrideDirectory: tempDir);
  ...
});
```

Each test gets a fresh, isolated directory. Real file I/O — no mocks, no in-memory filesystem abstraction. Good enough for unit-speed and catches real edge cases like JSON serialisation, file-name collisions, and directory listing order.

**When to use**: any class that reads or writes files via `path_provider`. Preferred over mocking `PathProviderPlatform`.

### 3. Synthetic `Position` helper for GPS-driven tests

Geolocator's `Position` has a dozen required fields. Each test file defines a `makePosition` helper so individual test bodies stay readable:

```dart
const lat = 47.37;
const lngBase = 8.54;
const metrePerDegLng = 111320 * 0.6773; // cos(47.37°)

Position makePosition({
  required double metresEast,
  required int secondsFromStart,
  double accuracy = 5,
}) {
  return Position(
    longitude: lngBase + metresEast / metrePerDegLng,
    latitude: lat,
    timestamp: DateTime(2026, 4, 10, 10, 0, secondsFromStart),
    accuracy: accuracy,
    altitude: 400,
    altitudeAccuracy: 2,
    heading: 90,
    headingAccuracy: 5,
    speed: 2.5,
    speedAccuracy: 1,
  );
}
```

Expressing positions as `(metresEast, secondsFromStart)` instead of raw lat/lng + wall-clock DateTimes makes intent clear — "6 m in 2 s at 3 m/s" is obviously a run segment.

**When to use**: any test involving GPS positions or waypoints. The same trick works for `Waypoint` in `run_stats_test.dart`.

---

### 4. `pumpUntil` — wait on a condition, never on a duration

Widget tests run on a fake clock, so any chain that only resolves on the *real* event loop — a stream cancel, a file write, a platform-channel reply — makes no progress under `pump` alone. `tester.runAsync` is what turns that loop, and the tempting shape is `runAsync(() async { trigger(); await Future.delayed(someMillis); })`. That delay is a sleep standing in for synchronisation: it passes on a developer machine and fails on a loaded CI runner, which is exactly how the Finish-hold helper flaked on two unrelated Dependabot PRs (decisions.md § 715).

Use `test/pump_until.dart` instead:

```dart
await pumpUntil(tester, () => store.rows.isNotEmpty,
    describe: 'the composer save to land in the store');
```

It alternates a short real-event-loop slice with a frame pump until the predicate holds. The `timeout` is a **failure bound, not the wait itself** — on expiry it `fail()`s naming what never happened, so a real regression is loud rather than slept through. Never widen it to make a test pass; find what the test is actually waiting for and say so in `describe`.

The same file carries `holdFinish`, the RunScreen Finish-hold drive built on it: it invokes the hold-to-stop button's wired `onHoldComplete` (which is `_stop` itself, so the dynamic call hands back its future) and waits for that future rather than for a duration. Pass `until:` for the one case where `_stop` deliberately parks — the post-live keep-public dialog.

**When to use**: any assertion that depends on async work with no future you can await. **When not to**: a delay that *models elapsed time* (a debounce window, a throttle, an auto-pause interval, a GPS blackout, a hanging fetcher proving a `.timeout()` fires) is the test's subject and must stay a delay.

**Picking the predicate** (decisions.md § 723 — the residue sweep that worked § 715 down from 58 sites to 14):

- **A local store's row list is not its write.** `OfflineSyncStore.persist` puts the row into `rowsById` *before* `writeJsonAtomic`, and calls `notifyListeners()` only once the row file and the index are both on disk. So `store.rows.isNotEmpty` returns while the write is in flight, and an `addTearDown` that deletes the temp dir then races it. Wait on the notification — `store.addListener(() => persisted = true)` in the fixture, which needs no seam in production code — or on a UI state the screen only reaches after `persist()` returns (a saved banner, a flipped chip).
- **Never a route transition, animation, or dialog dismissal.** `pumpUntil` deliberately does not advance the fake clock, so a pop's exit transition never completes inside it and the `AlertDialog` stays in the tree for the whole wait.
- **Not from inside `tester.runAsync`.** `pumpUntil` calls `runAsync` itself and it does not nest; a test whose body is already wrapped has to be restructured first.
- **Check the predicate is ever false.** A `pumpUntil` whose condition already holds on its first evaluation has converted nothing, and reading the diff will not tell you. Temporarily count the iterations inside `pumpUntil` and run the file: zero means either the work is microtask-only (the preceding `pump()` already drained it, and the wait is a guard rather than a wait) or the predicate is wrong — one converted case waited on a run being synced when the fixture had already synced it.

### 5. The store-write watch — every mobile test is checked for a write it did not wait for

`apps/mobile_android/test/flutter_test_config.dart` runs before every test in that directory and installs a `StoreWriteObserver` on `serialiseStoreWrite`, the chain every disk-backed mobile store serialises its directory-mutating work through. A test that ends with an operation still on that chain **fails in teardown**, naming the store directory and the stack that queued it. The failure is not pedantry: a widget test's `tester.tap` runs on the fake clock while the write it starts completes on the real event loop, so the file I/O is still in flight when `tearDown` deletes the temp directory out from under it — and the torn rename is either silent or an unattributable failure in whichever test runs next (decisions.md § 1129).

Three ways to satisfy it, in order of preference:

1. **An observable outcome via `pumpUntil`** — a saved banner, a flipped chip, a listener the fixture set. Best, because it says what the test is waiting for.
2. **The store's own `debugWritesSettled()`**, awaited from inside `tester.runAsync`, when the test constructs the store and holds a handle to it. It is bounded and reports itself rather than hanging when the zone precondition is not met (decisions.md § 1093).
3. **`pumpUntilStoreWritesSettle(tester)`** from `test/store_write_watch.dart`, when the store belongs to the **screen** — there is no handle to call `debugWritesSettled` on, and no UI signal that tracks the file rather than the in-memory row, so the chain being empty *is* the observable outcome. It is an ordinary bounded `pumpUntil`, never a fixed delay, and costs nothing where nothing is open.

`allowStoreWritesToOutliveTest(why)` is not an escape hatch. Its only honest use is a test whose **subject** is an unsettleable write — `storeWritesSettled`'s own zone precondition cannot be pinned without queueing one from a zone nothing will drain. A screen test that taps and does not wait is the defect the watch exists to name, not a case for the exemption.

Reaching a screen's completion path for the first time can surface a *second* pending-work failure underneath the first — the framework's own `A Timer is still pending even after the widget tree was disposed`. Do not pump a fixed duration past it. That assertion is raised from **inside the test body**, after the harness unmounts the tree and before any `tearDown` runs, so no harness cleanup can reach it and the only remedy available to a test was a drain pump; the durable answer is for the widget to own its own clock, which is what `showTopBanner`'s pill now does (decisions.md § 1195). A pending timer under a widget you control is that widget's bug, not the test's.

### 6. Owning the day — a Playwright spec may not assert over rows it did not seed

`decisions.md § 728` covers the *zone* half of this: a seed built with local-time `Date` getters lands on the adjacent calendar day from the one the UTC-pinned browser reads. The other half is that a row can be on the right day and still not be yours. `apps/backend/supabase/seed.sql` places rows for the shared users relative to the database's own `now()` — four `food_log` meals on USER_A's day at −8 h / −5 h / −4 h / −1 h, plus `body_metrics`, `gym_workouts`, `runs` and challenge windows — so a surface that aggregates "everything today" sees them alongside whatever the spec seeded.

`nutrition/recipes.spec.ts` asserted `ingredient_count === 2` after seeding two meals. "Save as recipe" builds the recipe from **every** entry on the diary's current day, so the count was 2 only when the seed happened to run inside the 00:00–01:00 UTC hour and 6 for any seed after 08:00 UTC — measured at 17:14 UTC as `Expected: 2, Received: 6`, with the summed-macro and ingredient-name assertions moving with it.

Three scopings are honest, in this order:

1. **A unique per-run name or stamp** — an `item_name` carrying a per-run `Date.now()` — so every read is filtered to rows the spec created. Always prefer this; it needs no cleanup beyond the spec's own rows and cannot collide with a sibling.
2. **Own the window**: delete it first, through `browserDayStart()` from `tests-e2e/fixtures/dates.ts` so the boundary is the *browser's* midnight. Necessary when the surface under test aggregates the whole day and a name filter therefore cannot reach it — the recipe and meal-template save paths are the two.
3. **A relative or `>=` assertion** (`initialTotal + 1`) when neither of the above fits.

Never a bare exact count over a shared user's day. `fixtures/dates.test.ts` enforces the one case where it is mechanically decidable: a spec that drives `save-as-meal` or `save-as-recipe` must first clear the day through `browserDayStart()`, and the guard fails naming the spec. A sweep of the tree found this to be the only genuine collision, with one fragile near-miss (`challenges/pace.spec.ts`, whose challenge window admits the seed's own morning run but whose assertions are qualitative enough not to flip).

### 7. A rate-limit bucket is one row per hour, shared by the whole run

`public.rate_limits` is keyed `(user_id, bucket, window_start)` where the window is the clock hour, so a spec that creates a route or a club is spending a budget every other spec in the run — and every run started in the same hour — is spending too. Three specs deliberately plant `USER_A`'s counter at its cap to pin the friendly "you are doing this too quickly" copy: `routes/import.spec.ts` and `routes/new.spec.ts` at 30 `create_route`, `clubs/new.spec.ts` at 5 `create_club`.

Two rules follow, and both are about the fact that Playwright **abandons** a timed-out test rather than unwinding it, so a `try/finally` inside a test body is not a cleanup guarantee.

1. **Undo a plant in `test.afterEach`**, never in an in-body `finally`. A cap test that times out between the plant and its cleanup leaves the counter at the cap for the rest of the hour, and every subsequent create in the suite then fails with the cap's own error.
2. **State the budget in `test.beforeEach`** — `resetRateLimit(USER_A.id, 'create_route')` — in every spec that creates through the UI. A test's precondition is its own to state, not a previous test's teardown to guarantee.

The club side has had (2) since the cap tests were written — all four specs that create a club as `USER_A` reset in `beforeEach`. The route side had none of it, and that is what produced the round-43 report of `routes/builder.spec.ts`'s save flow plus exactly four `routes/import.spec.ts` cases failing once and never reproducing: those are precisely the creates between the start of the directory and `import.spec.ts`'s own cap test, whose cleanup then cleared the counter and let the rest pass. A full `tests-e2e/routes/` run peaks the counter at **1**, so the budget itself is never the constraint — a leaked plant is. Planting 30 by hand reproduces the five failures exactly, and they go green with the resets in place.

`clubs/new.spec.ts` still undoes its plant in an in-body `finally`, which is harmless only because every club-creating spec already resets in `beforeEach`; it is filed rather than changed here.

### 8. A route mock goes through `mockRoute`, and one that never fires is a failure

Playwright compiles `**/auth/v1/user` to `^(.*/)auth/v1/user$`. It does not match `/auth/v1/user?redirect_to=…`, which is what `supabase.auth.updateUser(…, { emailRedirectTo })` actually sends. Nothing reports the miss: the request goes to the real server, the stub's body is never used, and any `expect(sawRequest).toBe(false)` beside it is scored against a handler nothing invoked.

`tests-e2e/fixtures/mock-route.ts` is the instrument. Take `test` from it, take `mockRoute` off the fixture object, and pass the routing target first:

```ts
import { expect, test } from '../fixtures/mock-route';

test('…', async ({ page, mockRoute }) => {
	await mockRoute(page, '**/api/coach', (route) => route.fulfill({ … }));
});
```

It counts the handler's invocations and fails the case from fixture teardown when the count is zero, naming the pattern and the line that registered it. The check is skipped when the test has already failed, so a dead mock never masks the real cause.

There is no blanket opt-out. Where a mock is *meant* never to fire — a private run never reaches the clipped-track branch; a render-gated chat never posts to `/api/coach` — say so in words with `{ neverFires: 'why' }`, which asserts the count at **zero** instead and fails if the mock starts firing. Where the mock is a `beforeEach` stub installed for the whole file and this one case does not exercise it, say so from inside the case with `mockRoute.neverFires(pattern, 'why')`; that declaration is itself checked, and naming a pattern no mock in the test registered fails, so a moved or renamed stub cannot leave the sentence behind.

**What it does not prove.** The count is per registration, not per branch. A handler that `continue()`s a `GET` and stubs a `PUT` on the same path fires on the `GET` alone, so the check says the pattern is reachable — not that the branch the case cares about ran. `settings/account.spec.ts` keeps its own `seen.put` counter beside the stub for exactly that reason, and a spec whose subject is one method should do the same.

**Adoption is enforced, and the rule is derived rather than listed.** `fixtures/mock-route.test.ts` (web unit suite) scans the tree and fails on a bare `.route()` call that either (a) records that its handler ran — `+= 1`, `++`, `= true`, `.push(` — or (b) answers a GoTrue / Edge Function / `/api/` endpoint with a success (a 2xx `fulfill`, a `fulfill` with no status, a `continue`, a `fallback`). Those are the two shapes whose absence is invisible: a counted mock makes its own count vacuous, and a success stub on a side-effecting endpoint is indistinguishable from the real endpoint answering. A `/rest/v1/` read shaped with a 4xx/5xx is deliberately **not** covered — if it stops firing the error state never renders and the case fails on its own assertion.

Two things the instrument found the moment it was switched on, both of which are worth knowing before writing a share-page spec:

- **Thirteen mocks in the tree were already dead.** Seven were a race: six `**/functions/v1/clip-public-track` stubs in `share/run.spec.ts` and one in `cross-cutting/smoke.spec.ts`, whose cases finished in 140–450 ms — before the client `load()` that calls the Edge Function had resolved. Every one of those cases was asserting against a half-mounted page reached from the server-rendered shell. The fix is to wait for `.run-meta`, which `RunShareView` renders only after `load()` returns; the mock then fires deterministically and the assertion is about the page the visitor actually gets. **A mock whose firing is a race is a case whose subject is a race.**
- **A `beforeEach` stub only some cases exercise belongs to those cases.** `routes/generate-loop.spec.ts` installed an OSRM straight-line mock for all 30 of its cases; `/api/routes/generate` answers the whole route, so 28 of them never reached it. It now lives in the two that drive the client's OSRM fallback. Where moving it is not the answer — that file's generator stub is used by twenty cases and replaced or unneeded by ten — the ten say so with `mockRoute.neverFires`.
- **A mock the spec replaces is not dead.** A later `mockRoute` on the same target and pattern supersedes an earlier one, because Playwright runs the most recent handler first. A replacement installed with a bare `page.route` is invisible to the fixture, so that case declares the silence instead.

### 9. An optimistic class flip is not evidence the write left the browser

Every optimistic handler in the app sets local state and *then* awaits the network — `toggleStar` is the canonical one. A spec that asserts the class and immediately calls `page.reload()` cancels the in-flight request it is about to check, and the reload then reads a row the write never reached. It passes on a fast machine and fails under load, with the row left in the pre-click state.

Read the row before navigating away: `await expect.poll(readStarredFlag).toBe(true)` between the click and the reload. The same rule covers any one-shot DOM read of a settling layout — `boundingBox()` is not a web-first assertion, so `dashboard/page.spec.ts`'s 44 px tap-target check polls it rather than snapshotting it once.

## How to add a new test

### For a pure function

Easiest case — no mocks, no hooks, no filesystem.

1. Create `test/<feature>_test.dart` in the package that owns the function.
2. Import `package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart` and the code under test.
3. Write `group` + `test` blocks with `expect` assertions.
4. Run `flutter test test/<feature>_test.dart`.

Model to copy: **`run_stats_test.dart`**.

### For a class that wraps a plugin (sensors, permissions, storage)

Don't mock the plugin. Add a hook.

1. In the class, add a `@visibleForTesting` method that bypasses the plugin init. Name it `debug<Operation>`.
2. Add `@visibleForTesting` getters for any internal state the test needs to observe.
3. Import `package:flutter/foundation.dart` in the production file for the annotation.
4. In the test, construct the class directly, call `debug<Operation>()`, exercise the public API, assert on the internal-state getters.

Model to copy: **`run_recorder_test.dart`**.

### For a class that touches the filesystem

Inject the directory.

1. Add an `overrideDirectory` (or similar) parameter to whatever method takes the path from `path_provider`.
2. In tests, `setUp` with `Directory.systemTemp.createTempSync(...)` and `tearDown` with `deleteSync(recursive: true)`.
3. Pass the temp dir into the override.

Model to copy: **`local_run_store_test.dart`**.

### Run the new test

```bash
# The single file, fast
flutter test test/your_new_test.dart

# Or with filtering by test name
flutter test --plain-name "your new scenario"

# Or the whole package
flutter test

# Or the whole workspace
cd /path/to/threkir
melos exec --scope="run_recorder" --scope="mobile_android" --scope="api_client" --scope="gpx_parser" --scope="ui_kit" --scope="core_models" -- flutter test
```

## Schema codegen — how to test the drift detector

The `database.types.ts` (TypeScript) and `db_rows.dart` (Dart) row classes are regenerated from the Supabase migrations on every schema change. The point of generating them is to force a compile error if a client drifts. To verify the safety net still works:

```bash
# 1. Create a scratch migration that renames a column
cd apps/backend
supabase migration new scratch_rename_distance
echo "alter table runs rename column distance_m to total_distance_m;" \
    >> supabase/migrations/*_scratch_rename_distance.sql
supabase db reset

# 2. Regenerate both row files
cd ../..
npm run gen:types
dart run scripts/gen_dart_models.dart

# 3. Expect both clients to fail their builds with useful errors
cd apps/web && npm run check          # errors in mock-data.ts, data.ts, etc.
cd ../.. && melos exec -- dart analyze # errors in api_client.dart

# 4. Roll back — delete the scratch migration and reset
rm apps/backend/supabase/migrations/*_scratch_rename_distance.sql
cd apps/backend && supabase db reset
cd ../..
npm run gen:types
dart run scripts/gen_dart_models.dart
git status                             # should show no diff on the generated files
```

If step 3 produces a clean build, something in the generator pipeline has broken and drift is no longer being caught — treat this as a test failure and investigate before merging anything else.

To test just the TypeScript side of the CI gate locally:

```bash
cd apps/backend
npm run gen:types:check   # exit 0 = in sync, non-zero = drift with a diff printed
```

## What's *not* covered (honest)

- **`RunScreen` finish + save UI flow — now covered.** Idle, countdown, recording-state-entry, live-position ingestion, **and the Finish hold → `_stop()` → `runStore.save(run)` path** are all covered (`run_screen_test.dart` 4 tests + `run_screen_recording_flow_test.dart` 6 tests). The Finish-save test invokes the rendered hold-to-stop button's wired `onHoldComplete` (the 800 ms `Ticker` is unreliable to drive under the fake clock) through the shared `holdFinish` helper, which waits on the `_stop()` future that call hands back rather than on a fixed delay (the recorder's position-stream cancel only completes on the real event loop — see Pattern 4 and decisions.md § 715), against a `_CapturingRunStore` spy (the real store's `save` does filesystem I/O that doesn't resolve under fake-async), then asserts a run was saved with the chosen activity type. The data-pipeline equivalent stays covered by `recording_integration_test.dart` (recorder → LocalRunStore → SyncService → fake API).
- **Device-instrumented `integration_test` package tests.** None yet. `recording_integration_test.dart` covers the same golden path as a heavy widget test, which catches the same regressions cheaper. A true device-driven `integration_test` would add value for tile-cache, foreground-service, and background-sync paths that need real Android primitives.
- **`ApiClient` wire-level methods.** The DI seam exists — `ApiClient.withClient(SupabaseClient)` named constructor lets tests inject a fake without booting `Supabase.initialize` (4 tests in `api_client_di_test.dart`). The **priority five** methods (`signIn`, `getRuns`, `fetchTrack`, `saveRun`, `_uploadTrack`) are now covered by `api_client_integration_test.dart` — 3 tests against a live local Supabase via the seed user (`runner@test.com / testtest`), gated by `SUPABASE_TEST_URL` env. The saveRun test exercises the full Storage roundtrip (`saveRun` → `_uploadTrack` → DB row → `getRuns` → `fetchTrack`) and surfaced two real bugs on first run: (1) `_uploadTrack` + `uploadTrackBytes` set `contentType: 'application/json'` for gzipped JSON bytes, which the `runs` bucket MIME allowlist (migration 20260815_001) 415's — fixed in commit alongside the test; (2) the seed.sql sets `track_url` to exercise the path-shape CHECK but doesn't upload an actual file (kept that way; the saveRun test uses a fresh upload it owns end-to-end). The remaining 100+ `ApiClient` methods are still uncovered — the codec layer (`_runFromRow`, `_routeFromRow`, waypoint round-trip) is covered by `api_client_codecs_test.dart`, which is where the bug-yield is highest; the rest of the wire layer is mostly thin "build query, send, deserialize" code where the codec is the meaningful part.
- **`SocialService` and `TrainingService` ChangeNotifier glue.** Pure helpers + the role-derivation booleans on `ClubView` are covered by `social_service_test.dart` (13 tests). The Supabase-touching methods on both classes now have a DI seam — `SocialService.withClient(SupabaseClient)` and `TrainingService.withClient(SupabaseClient)` — mirroring `ApiClient.withClient`. Wire-level integration coverage lives in `apps/mobile_android/test/services_integration_test.dart` (21 tests, gated on `SUPABASE_TEST_URL`, run by the `api-client-integration` CI job that boots local Supabase). Covers: `browseClubs` (x2 — query + empty-query), `fetchMyClubs`, `fetchClubBySlug` (x2 — known + unknown), `fetchClubRoutes`, `fetchClubPosts`, `fetchPostReplies`, `createPost`+`deletePost` roundtrip, `fetchUpcomingEvents`, `fetchEventById`, `fetchAttendees`, `fetchRecentRuns`, plus `TrainingService.fetchMyPlans`, `fetchActiveOverview`, `fetchPlan` (x2 — known + unknown), `fetchWorkout`, `fetchPlanForWorkout`, `updateWorkout` roundtrip, `fetchClubTemplates`. Remaining uncovered methods: write paths that touch event_results / race sessions / club admin transitions (`joinClub`, `leaveClub`, `approveJoinRequest`, `denyJoinRequest`, `createEvent`, `rsvpEvent` + `clearRsvp`, `submitEventResult`, `armRace` / `startRace` / `endRace`), and TrainingService write paths (`createPlan`, `publishPlanAsTemplate` + `clonePlanTemplate`, `markCompleted`, `deletePlan`, `updateStatus`). ~15 methods left; each is one block per method, not a refactor. Service-level errors here are bounded — failure modes are stale lists or missed-RSVPs, not data leaks (RLS gates the actual rows; see the pgtap suite).
- **Edge Function HTTP envelope.** The pure security-critical helpers (`timingSafeEqual`, `validateFreshness`, `hmacHex`, `mapEventToTier`, etc.) are covered by `_shared/webhook_security.test.ts` + `_shared/body_limit.test.ts` + `revenuecat-webhook/lib.test.ts` (45 deno tests). Wire-level auth-rejection coverage of the five webhook / cron / hook handlers that bypass the platform `verify_jwt` gate (refresh-tokens, strava-webhook, revenuecat-webhook, stripe-events-webhook, auth-email) lives in `_shared/handler_envelope.test.ts` (23 cases) — gated by `SUPABASE_TEST_URL`, mutation-checked against the served tree since [decisions § 815](../architecture/decisions.md), and driven by the `edge-functions` CI job which boots Supabase, replaces the auto-started edge runtime with `supabase functions serve --env-file` (the auto-started runtime ignores `.env.local` and 503's every secret-gated call), and hits the function endpoints over HTTP. The full happy-path with valid HMACs / freshness / dedupe is still exercised manually only — see [apps/backend/CLAUDE.md § Testing without real credentials](../../apps/backend/CLAUDE.md#testing-without-real-credentials).

If you want to expand coverage, the best remaining targets in priority order: (1) stand up a true `integration_test` harness for the device-led paths; (2) keep widening the `SocialService` / `TrainingService` wire-level suite (the seam + 21-test scaffold from `services_integration_test.dart` covers the read paths; the remaining ~15 write paths are still uncovered — each is one block per method).

## Continuous integration

Tests run in CI via `melos exec` directly — the per-script lookup that `melos run` uses is broken on Melos 7 (see the gotcha in the root [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md)), so the workflow drives the binary by command instead. From [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml):

```yaml
- run: melos bootstrap
- run: melos exec --scope="run_recorder" --scope="mobile_android" --scope="api_client" --scope="gpx_parser" --scope="ui_kit" --scope="core_models" -- flutter test
- run: melos exec -- dart analyze
```

The scopes name every package that owns a test body except `apps/mobile_ios`, whose files `twin-parity` proves identical to `apps/mobile_android`'s — see [Which runner a package takes](#which-runner-a-package-takes), which `packages/api_client/test/test_runner_test.dart` keeps in step with this list. The scopes used to be `run_recorder` + `mobile_android` alone, and `ui_kit` + `core_models` carried 16 test files between them that had therefore never run in CI at all. `melos exec -- dart analyze` walks every Flutter package and gates on the analyzer. See [architecture.md — CI/CD](../architecture/architecture.md#cicd-pipeline) for the rest of the pipeline wiring.

Every job `ci.yml` defines runs on every PR + push to `main` — the count is not written down here because the number that was (“nineteen”) went stale and disagreed with [architecture.md](../architecture/architecture.md)’s; recompute it with `awk '/^jobs:/{j=1;next} j&&/^[^ ]/{j=0} j&&/^  [A-Za-z0-9_-]+:$/{n++} END{print n}' .github/workflows/ci.yml` (35 on 2026-09-07). The principal ones, and the only list here: `test-packages` (Flutter), `test-worker` (Go job worker), `test-graph-cycle` (Go graph-cycle map sidecar), `parity-types` (migration-version-key uniqueness guard + web TS unit tests + CHECK-constraint guard + the `tests-e2e` typecheck run up front with no DB, then TS schema drift against the live stack — the source-only checks deliberately run *before* `supabase start` so a broken stack can't silently skip the web unit suite, as a migration collision did for ~2 days in run 26822355308), `build-web` (`svelte-check`, then a production-mode `vite build` of `apps/web` as a **compile gate — it never deploys**; the prod/preview release stays gated in `release-web.yml` on publishing a `web@*` GitHub Release. Added after run 26844715187, where a Svelte 5.56.0 compile error reached `main` because the only `vite build` lived in the PR-only `web-bundle-budget.yml` and a direct push skipped it, so the broken route surfaced only by chance through one Playwright shard; this job rebuilds every route on push *and* PR so a compile error fails loudly here instead. Feeds placeholder `PUBLIC_*` env values — the build resolves those through `$env/static/public` at build time, so real secrets are irrelevant and absent. It then measures that build against the four bundle ceilings via `scripts/check_web_bundle_budget.mjs`, which used to be `web-bundle-budget.yml` — a workflow in no `needs:` of the `CI gate`, so a red budget did not block a merge; moving it here costs 0.2 s on a build that was already running and retires a job that repeated the same install and build, decisions § 775), `parity-matrix` (`scripts/check_parity_matrix.dart` for the matrix's table structure + legal symbols, `scripts/check_parity_ios_column.mjs` for the iOS column against the single rule the doc states for it, and `scripts/check_parity_pair_registry.mjs` for the TS↔Dart pair registries — all three ungated, because every file they read is markdown and the `changes` filter would skip the job on exactly the edits it polices), `build-watch-wear` (Wear OS Kotlin assemble + unit tests), `test-watch-ios` (watchOS `xcodebuild test` on a macOS runner — the `WatchAppTests` suite), `build-firmware` (Rust custom-watch firmware), `build-mobile-android` (release APK smoke), `twin-parity` (mobile_android ↔ mobile_ios byte-identical check), `schema-codegen-drift` (Dart + Kotlin row-class regen + diff), `api-client-integration` (real Supabase: `api_client` wire-level + mobile services), `cross-client-roundtrip` (real Supabase: a run, a route, AND an in-progress live run saved by the Dart `api_client` must each read back field-for-field through the web data layer — described below), `edge-functions` (Deno: pure helpers + HTTP envelope), `pgtap-rls` (pgTAP RLS suite), `e2e-web` (Playwright, **sharded 14 ways** — `--shard=N/14` across a 14-entry matrix, so it's 14 parallel runner jobs under one job id), and the two dedicated Playwright lanes `e2e-web-livehub` + `e2e-web-sso` described below. The `e2e-web` job stands up the local Supabase stack (`supabase start` applies the migrations *and* runs seed.sql; we deliberately avoid `supabase db reset`, whose mid-flight storage-container restart + health-poll is a chronic CI flake, and just assert the seed user landed afterward), installs workspace deps with `pnpm`, caches the Chromium download keyed on `pnpm-lock.yaml`, installs the browser through the shared `./.github/actions/install-playwright` composite action, writes `apps/web/.env` from `supabase status -o env`, and runs `pnpm test:e2e`. That action is why the browser download and its system libraries are two separate `playwright` subcommands rather than one `install --with-deps`: `--with-deps` runs `apt-get update` from inside the download, so the apt half has no budget of its own and a single unreachable Ubuntu mirror stalls the whole step — which took `main` red twice in five hours on 2026-08-17/18 (runs 32069680540 and 32090988359) by hanging shards for 23 minutes until `timeout-minutes: 25` killed them, with every other job green. Split, the apt half is bounded at 120s x 3 and fails loudly naming the mirrors. Since 2026-08-18 it is also **conditional**: the apt half only ever verified — every library it installs is already the newest version on the hosted image — so an outage in a third party was failing test shards that would have passed, five of them across two pushes that day (round 4: shards 1, 7, 13; round 5: shards 6, 7), each three timed-out attempts then a hard fail with no test run and a clean re-run. The action now verifies the libraries directly by **launching Chromium** (the same headless-shell binary `devices['Desktop Chrome']` drives, and strictly stronger than reading `ldd`, which cannot see what Chromium dlopens) and reaches for apt only when that launch fails. The verdict afterwards is another launch, not apt's exit code — install-deps can succeed with the launch still broken, and can fail on a mirror having already installed what was missing — and a launch that still fails fails the step with the browser's own error naming the library. The check cannot pass vacuously: any launch failure, for any reason, sends the job to apt. See [decisions.md § 627](../architecture/decisions.md). On failure it uploads `playwright-report/` + `test-results/` (traces + screenshots + videos for retried tests) for 7 days. Total wall-clock: ~3-4 minutes on the free runner. Every stack-using job (`parity-types`, `schema-codegen-drift`, `api-client-integration`, `cross-client-roundtrip`, `edge-functions`, `pgtap-rls`, `e2e-web`) boots the stack through the shared `./.github/actions/start-supabase` composite action rather than an inline copy. Its retry force-removes any container still publishing a stack port **and tears down any leftover `supabase_network_*` docker network**, then gates on both being clear before re-running — `supabase stop` alone does **not** free an orphaned host port after a partial start ([supabase/cli#3265](https://github.com/supabase/cli/issues/3265)), which let run 26860851075 (e2e shard 7) die when both attempts re-hit `failed to bind host port for 0.0.0.0:54322: address already in use`. The container force-remove was not enough on its own: a partial start can also strand the stack's docker *network* with a dangling endpoint that reserves 54322 at the docker layer with **no container and nothing in LISTEN**, so the `ss`-based probe sees every port free yet the bind still fails — the recurrence in run 27567813578 (e2e shard 10). The gate now treats a stranded stack network as a holder `ss` can't see: it cleans it and verifies it's gone before the next attempt. A third holder class needs no leftover state at all: the stack ports sit inside Linux's default ephemeral source-port range (32768-60999), so an outbound socket — e.g. one of the ghcr.io image-pull connections active during `supabase start` — can land on source port 54322 and fail the db bind on a **fresh** runner with nothing in LISTEN and zero containers (run 28864778110, e2e shard 7, both attempts). The action now reserves 54321-54327 via `net.ipv4.ip_local_reserved_ports` before the first attempt (gated with a loud failure if the sysctl doesn't take), so the kernel never hands a stack port to an outbound connection. Once the CLI returns, the action waits for the sidecars to actually serve — storage REST, the edge runtime's own 405, and a real GoTrue password grant — through `wait_for_sidecars.sh`. That wait is bounded by a **wall-clock** deadline, not an attempt count: it used to count 45 attempts and call that "90s" while curl's per-attempt `--max-time` went uncharged, so the two 2026-08-14 failures spent ~9 minutes reporting a 90 s timeout. Each attempt is now charged against the deadline, the last one's `--max-time` is clamped to what remains, the failure states the elapsed seconds and attempts it really spent, and giving up dumps the stack's container list, per-container state + exit code, and the failing sidecar's plus kong's `docker logs` tail. The loop lives in a script rather than inline in `action.yml` so `wait_for_sidecars.test.mjs` can drive it with stub `curl`/`docker` on `PATH` — that test runs in `workflow-lint`, since shell inside a composite action otherwise runs in no suite at all. The 90 s deadline is sized against measured green runs — 277 jobs across 14 workflow runs took a median of 1.21 s and a maximum of 12.15 s, with exactly one needing a single retry — not against the attempt count it replaced. See [decisions.md § 697](../architecture/decisions.md).

These jobs are not individually required for merge: branch protection requires a single status check — the **`CI gate`** aggregator job in `ci.yml`, which `needs:` all of them (on a docs-only diff the `changes` filter job skips them and the aggregator still reports), so a green `CI gate` is the merge gate rather than each job separately.

Three **dedicated** Playwright lanes run their own focused slices outside the sharded `e2e-web` job, each with its own config that boots an extra webServer: `e2e-web-livehub` (`playwright.livehub.config.ts` — the Go live-hub WebSocket path), `e2e-web-exporthub` (`playwright.exporthub.config.ts` — the queued Art 20 export rail against a real Go worker, added 2026-08-24; the sharded suite runs every other export spec against the Edge Function fallback because `PUBLIC_EXPORT_HUB_URL` is unset there, and setting it would flip all twelve onto an unmocked transport, so the rail gets its own lane rather than a flag) and `e2e-web-sso` (`playwright.sso.config.ts` — the OAuth/SSO login path, added 2026-06-10). The SSO lane drives the real `signInWithOAuth → /auth/callback → exchangeCodeForSession → session → /auth/confirm-age` path against a local `oauth2-mock-server`: GoTrue special-cases `google`/`apple`, so the mock is wired as the generic `keycloak` provider (`config.toml [auth.external.keycloak]`, inert unless the `SSO_MOCK_OIDC_*` env is set), and the only un-exercised piece is the provider *identity* (a literal Google login). Full rationale + the keycloak-stands-in-for-Google caveat: `apps/web/tests-e2e/sso/README.md`.

The `cross-client-roundtrip` job is the **runtime** drift net the static `gen:types:check` can't be: it proves a row *saved by the Dart `api_client`* reads back field-for-field through the *web's* data layer against the same local stack. `gen:types:check` proves the two generated row-type files agree with the schema, but two clients can still disagree on the **value** a write produces vs. a read consumes — `metadata.steps` written as a string but read through a `typeof === 'number'` guard, a `started_at` timezone skew, a `RunSource` enum that doesn't survive the round-trip. The job boots Supabase once, then runs four Dart-write → Node-read pairs against the same stack:

- **Runs** — Dart **write** half ([`packages/api_client/test/cross_client_roundtrip_test.dart`](../../packages/api_client/test/cross_client_roundtrip_test.dart) — `saveRun` a fixture run + emit the expected-field fixture to a workspace file), then the Node **read** half ([`apps/web/scripts/cross_client_roundtrip_read.mjs`](../../apps/web/scripts/cross_client_roundtrip_read.mjs) — re-read through `fetchRunById`'s exact query shape, importing the real `parseRunSource` from `src/lib/types` so the source-enum parse genuinely runs through web code, then assert deep equality incl. the gzipped-track decode).
- **Routes** — Dart **write** half ([`packages/api_client/test/cross_client_roundtrip_route_test.dart`](../../packages/api_client/test/cross_client_roundtrip_route_test.dart) — `saveRoute` a fixture route: name, a 3-point `waypoints` array with `ele`, distance, elevation gain, the `RouteSurface` narrow union (`'trail'`), tags, `is_public`, description), then the Node **read** half ([`apps/web/scripts/cross_client_roundtrip_route_read.mjs`](../../apps/web/scripts/cross_client_roundtrip_route_read.mjs) — re-read through `fetchRouteById`'s exact owner-read shape, importing the real `parseRouteSurface` from `src/lib/types` so the surface narrow runs through web code, then assert deep equality on every field incl. the waypoint structure). Two routes-specific checks: the trigger-owned `shadow_hidden` moderation column (migration `20270218_001`) — `saveRoute` strips it on write, the column defaults false, and the assertions confirm it both round-trips false **and** is stripped from `fetchRouteById`'s read shape (the public view already projects it away; the owner read now does too, and narrows `surface` through `parseRouteSurface`).
- **In-progress (live spectator) runs** — Dart **write** half ([`packages/api_client/test/cross_client_roundtrip_live_test.dart`](../../packages/api_client/test/cross_client_roundtrip_live_test.dart) — `beginLiveBroadcast` opens a stub `runs` row, then `insertLivePing` appends 3 out-of-zone pings carrying `lat`/`lng`/`ele`/`distance_m`/`elapsed_s`), then the Node **read** half ([`apps/web/scripts/cross_client_roundtrip_live_read.mjs`](../../apps/web/scripts/cross_client_roundtrip_live_read.mjs) — re-reads the run through the `/live/[id]` spectator read shapes: the `public_runs` visibility view (finding the row there at all is the `is_public` round-trip) + the `live_run_pings` catch-up query ordered by `at asc`, then asserts the per-ping fields in chronological order, the `started_at` instant, the stub `distance_m`). One in-progress-run-specific check: the trigger-owned `coarse` column (migration `20270121_001`) — `insertLivePing` doesn't write it, it defaults false for an out-of-zone ping, and the assertions confirm it round-trips false so a precise live fix is never surfaced as approximate.
- **Sync path (metadata-only re-save)** — Dart **write** half ([`packages/api_client/test/cross_client_roundtrip_sync_test.dart`](../../packages/api_client/test/cross_client_roundtrip_sync_test.dart) — `saveRun` a run WITH a 4-point track (uploads to Storage, stores `track_url`), then re-save it through the mobile sync semantics: a newer-wins, metadata-only edit with an empty `track` + the existing `metadata['track_url']` carried forward, editing distance / duration / `metadata.steps` and adding `notes`), then the Node **read** half ([`apps/web/scripts/cross_client_roundtrip_sync_read.mjs`](../../apps/web/scripts/cross_client_roundtrip_sync_read.mjs) — re-read through `fetchRunById`'s exact shape + the real `parseRunSource`, then assert the newer-wins values overwrote the first save's stale stats AND that `track_url` + the original GPS trace survived the metadata-only edit). This is the recurring **sync-conflict drift class**: a metadata edit that re-uploads or clobbers the track, a re-save that drops the existing `track_url`, or a newer-wins update that doesn't overwrite the stale stats.

Any mismatch in any pair exits non-zero and fails the PR. Each fixture's expected values live once on the Dart side and are written to a file the Node half reads (`cross_client_fixture.json` for runs, `cross_client_route_fixture.json` for routes, `cross_client_live_fixture.json` for in-progress runs, `cross_client_sync_fixture.json` for the sync path) — never duplicated. Scope today is **runs + routes + in-progress runs + the sync path**; the auth round-trip is a stretch that follows the same Dart-write → Node-read fixture pattern (see [roadmap.md § Cross-client integration test in CI](../product/roadmap.md)). All halves gate on `SUPABASE_TEST_URL`, so a plain `flutter test` skips the Dart halves; run them locally exactly as the job does — `supabase status -o env` for the URL + anon key, `CROSS_CLIENT_FIXTURE_OUT` / `CROSS_CLIENT_FIXTURE_IN` (runs), `CROSS_CLIENT_ROUTE_FIXTURE_OUT` / `CROSS_CLIENT_ROUTE_FIXTURE_IN` (routes), `CROSS_CLIENT_LIVE_FIXTURE_OUT` / `CROSS_CLIENT_LIVE_FIXTURE_IN` (in-progress runs), and `CROSS_CLIENT_SYNC_FIXTURE_OUT` / `CROSS_CLIENT_SYNC_FIXTURE_IN` (sync path) pointed at the same file.

The `pgtap-rls` job runs `cd apps/backend && supabase test db --local` against the migrations-only local stack (no `db reset` — every test file is wrapped in its own `begin; … rollback;` and uses synthetic fixture UUIDs that don't collide with `seed.sql`). A regression in any RLS policy or SECURITY DEFINER function fails the PR.

The same job then **mutation-checks the suite's refusal assertions**, because a green pgtap run says every assertion passed, not that every assertion asked anything. Under RLS a refused SELECT returns no rows rather than erroring, so `is_empty(...)` is simultaneously what a refusal looks like and what a fixture that never inserted looks like — two assertions in `rls_route_conditions_test` were the second thing for months ([decisions.md § 741](../architecture/decisions.md)). `apps/backend/scripts/check_pgtap_refusal_assertions.mjs` re-runs each refusal assertion with the mechanism that could be hiding a row **widened to the rows the test's own transaction wrote** and fails if it still passes: for a base table read that is one extra permissive `SELECT` policy on every RLS-enabled table ([§ 753](../architecture/decisions.md); it used to be a bypass to the BYPASSRLS owner, which revealed the whole table), and — since [§ 745](../architecture/decisions.md) — a permissive replacement of the relation itself for a read through a view or an RPC, which filters in its own SQL and so is untouched by RLS. 168 assertions across 259 files, ~34s. Since [§ 751](../architecture/decisions.md) each permissive replacement carries the same scope, on a per-entry `subject` alias naming the relation those rows come from — otherwise the mutation is answered by whatever `seed.sql` committed to the same table, and the kill says a subject exists rather than that the test filed one. The transaction-local test is a `SECURITY DEFINER` wrapper over `pg_xact_status` rather than an `xmin` comparison, because pgtap's own `lives_ok` / `throws_ok` file their payload in a subtransaction and a top-level comparison reads those fixtures as foreign ([§ 753](../architecture/decisions.md)). A second CI step (`--validate-operators`) proves each of the 24 replacements still reveals a subject its real relation hides *and that this transaction wrote*, that each operator's end-to-end trio kills a known-good refusal while leaving both a known-bad one and a **known-debris** one (a private route already committed by the seed) standing, and that the two definer relations deliberately left without a replacement are still exactly the ones the suite reads — an inert operator scores every assertion it touches as vacuous and is invisible inside a green mutation run, and an over-wide one scores a vacuous assertion as healthy. The static half fails any `throws_ok` pinning neither a SQLSTATE nor a message, and carries three POSITIVE scans besides: a `lives_ok` supplying a column a live BEFORE trigger stamps, one handing a value to a function that does not plant it verbatim, and one whose whole SQL is a single call to a writing function that no assertion AFTER it reads back ([decisions § 1540](../architecture/decisions.md), tightened from "anywhere in the file" to the ordered form by [§ 1605](../architecture/decisions.md) once the four sites that needed the weaker rule had their read-backs). All three replay the migrations, and that replay is keyed on each function's name AND arity — Postgres's own identity for a function, and what stops an overloaded one collapsing onto its last definition ([§ 1539](../architecture/decisions.md)); the trigger walk it feeds closes every block form plpgsql nests, including the two that close with a bare `end` ([§ 1538](../architecture/decisions.md)). Its own unit suite is `check_pgtap_refusal_assertions.test.mjs`, run by `node --test` in the same step.

The `edge-functions` job does the same for the Deno suite, and the operator is different because what hides a subject there is different — nothing in a pure-helper suite is hidden by access control. `apps/backend/scripts/check_edge_function_test_vacuity.mjs` replaces **every** non-test module under `supabase/functions` with a neutered twin (same exported names, same runtime shapes, no behaviour, no source text for a grep to read), blanks the four non-TypeScript artifacts a test reads *as its subject* (`config.toml`, `.env.development`, `.env.example`, the migrations), and re-runs the whole suite: a test that still passes was testing none of them. 21 of the 581 did at introduction ([decisions.md § 788](../architecture/decisions.md)) — a `try/catch` that swallowed its own assertion, four `ipBucketKey` anti-spoofing tests that compared two of the helper's own outputs and so were satisfied by a helper reading no header at all, five negative source greps that an empty file satisfies for free, and a speed claim that made no claim about the work. Shape preservation is the point and it is counter-intuitive: a stub that threw would score a vacuous test as a kill it never earned and hide it, so the guard also fails when a baseline test case is **absent** from the mutant report, because that case was not measured at all. It runs in ~8 s (the suite twice), needs no database, and runs before the Supabase stack starts. Its own unit suite is `check_edge_function_test_vacuity.test.mjs`, run by `node --test` in the step above it — including a case that neuters every real module in the tree and asserts the stub exports exactly the names the original did.

That operator reaches every case the **test process** imports, and `_shared/handler_envelope.test.ts` imports none of it — it drives the separately-booted `supabase functions serve` host over HTTP, so its cases were scored neither killed nor survived. `apps/backend/scripts/check_served_envelope_mutations.mjs` is the third operator in the same job and mutates the tree the **host** is serving: one gate at a time, requiring the case that names that gate to FAIL and the cases declared as its `spares` to keep passing. One mutation per round rather than a bundle, because a blanket break proves only that a case notices a dead function — the weaker claim § 788 already makes about everything else — and it is the spares that separate "this case measures the compare" from "this case measures that some gate exists". `functions serve` re-reads a changed module on the next request (under 1.4 s measured), so it costs no second tree, no second host and no second stack: 23 cases against 20 mutations in 58–69 s. **Coverage is enforced both ways** — a case no mutation claims fails the run, and a claim naming no case fails it too — so adding a case to `handler_envelope.test.ts` means adding the mutation that kills it in the same change. Three cases were survivors at introduction ([decisions.md § 815](../architecture/decisions.md)): a 403 answered by the gate *after* the one under test, a gate with no case at all, and a `200 "OK"` that a later branch returns verbatim. Each mutation also declares the answer its mutant settles on, and the round waits for exactly that, twice: waiting merely for a *changed* answer let a round run against a host mid-restart, whose gateway 503 differs from the baseline too — which is how the guard's first CI run reported a moved spare on a mutation that could not reach it. It needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for two reasons — the four side-effect cases skip without it, and it is how the `strava-webhook:anon` rate-limit bucket is emptied between rounds, since the 429 those cases tolerate as runner noise would otherwise read as the secret gate's refusal. Its own unit suite is `check_served_envelope_mutations.test.mjs`, whose two load-bearing cases run the shipped mutation table against the real handlers and the real test file, so a renamed gate or a renamed case fails without a host.

## Troubleshooting

**"No tests were found"** — the test file has no `void main()` function or no `test(...)` calls. Check the file has a top-level `main()` that invokes `group`/`test`.

**"Cannot read pubspec.lock"** — run `flutter pub get` at the repo root. The workspace uses pubspec overrides managed by Melos; `melos bootstrap` is the canonical setup.

**Tests pass locally but fail in CI** — in a widget test, first suspect a fixed `Future.delayed` or a fixed number of `pump`s standing in for "wait until this async thing finished"; that is Pattern 4's `pumpUntil` case, not a number to raise. Otherwise most commonly from wall-clock assumptions. The recorder used to have exactly this bug in its speed clamp (wall-clock dt went near zero under load). If you see flaky timing tests, use GPS-reported timestamps from the `Position` rather than `DateTime.now()`, and be suspicious of any direct `DateTime.now()` subtraction in production code. The same lesson hit `_calculatePace` — see decisions.md §46 — and the architecture guard `_currentWaypoint constructor uses pos.timestamp, not DateTime.now()` in `packages/run_recorder/test/architecture_guards_test.dart` pins the policy.

**Heavy parsers must run in `compute()` isolates.** Found during a UI-freeze audit: `StravaImporter.importFromZip`, `BackupService.createBackup` / `restore`, and the single-file route import in `routes_screen` were all running ZIP/GZip/XML/FIT parsing synchronously on the main isolate — a 5-year Strava export froze the UI for tens of seconds. All four sites now dispatch through `compute()` (see decisions.md §48). The architecture guards under `apps/mobile_android/test/architecture_guards_test.dart#heavy parsers run in compute() isolates` will fail if a future refactor inlines any of these calls back onto the UI thread. New parser-style code that touches user-supplied data of unbounded size should consult §48 before adding the call.

**The wall-clock vs GPS-time audit (one-time):** every `DateTime.now()` call across `packages/run_recorder/`, `packages/api_client/`, and `apps/mobile_android/lib/` was reviewed and triaged into four buckets — see decisions.md §46 for the live bug and the policy. Quick reference for new code:

- **Pure metadata / display** (run start time, lap timestamp, `imported_at`, share-file `<time>`, run-id generation, date pickers, "today" string) — wall-clock is correct.
- **Throttle / cooldown** (accuracy-drop log, pace-drift cue, pace alert, lock-screen-notification 1 Hz, live-broadcaster ping) — both sides wall-clock, internally consistent.
- **DB-stored timestamp vs wall-clock** (event "future from now", plan-day-index, race-elapsed badge, relative-time helpers) — UX-acceptable; depends on user device clock being roughly correct via NTP.
- **Duration math** (`_calculatePace`, lap durations) — must use a monotonic source (`Stopwatch.elapsed`) or GPS time (`pos.timestamp`). This is the bucket the original bug lived in. `LapSplit.cumulativeDuration` already uses `_stopwatch.elapsed`; the only other consumer was `_calculatePace` (fixed in §46) and the GPX `<time>` parser (fixed in §47).

**Dart analyzer complains that a `debug*` method on a production class isn't called** — the `@visibleForTesting` annotation suppresses this in test files but the warning still fires at the declaration site. Add `// ignore: invalid_use_of_visible_for_testing_member` only if you need to call from non-test code (you almost certainly don't).

### Specs that cannot pass on this workstation

Green in CI, red here, and neither is the diff's fault. Both cost a round to
diagnose before they were written down; check this list before spending another
one. Anything **not** listed is a real failure until proven otherwise — see the
`routes/detail.spec.ts` star case in [followups.md](../product/followups.md) for
a genuinely load-dependent one, which is a different animal from these two.

**`tests-e2e/routes/heatmap-pins.spec.ts` — both `clubs_in_bbox` cases.** They
fail as `[42501] permission denied for function clubs_in_bbox`, read through the
service-role fixture client (`getAdminClient()`). Every migration that defines
the function revokes EXECUTE `from public` and grants it `to anon, authenticated`
(`20260911_001`, re-emitted in `20260912_001`; `20270128_001` and `20270218_001`
`create or replace` it and inherit that ACL). `service_role` is never granted by
name — the RPC only ever answers a service-role caller when the CLI image's own
bootstrap hands `service_role` a default EXECUTE, which CI's pinned **2.84.2**
does and the **2.109.1** on this workstation's PATH does not. **Do not "fix" it
with a `grant execute … to service_role` in a migration**: production's client
traffic is anon/authenticated, so that widens a production grant to silence a
local-only artifact. Drive the stack from the repo's own `npx supabase` (2.116.0
restored the default — measured 2026-08-28, when the whole pgtap suite passed
under it including `donations_status_lock_test` and `coach_roster_summary_test`,
which fail under 2.109.1 for exactly this reason), or trust CI. Those two pgtap
failures are recorded in [test_inventory.md](test_inventory.md) as the same
split.

**`tests-e2e/settings/account.spec.ts` § "change email — request path" — fixed,
and kept here for the second half.** The case used to fail as `element(s) not
found` on `email-change-pending`, which read exactly like a product bug and was
two problems stacked:

1. *The mock was dead.* The case intends to fulfil `PUT /auth/v1/user` itself,
   but `page.route('**/auth/v1/user', …)` never matched the request.
   `handleChangeEmail` passes `emailRedirectTo`, and `@supabase/auth-js` appends
   it as a `?redirect_to=…` query string; Playwright anchors a glob at **both**
   ends (`**/auth/v1/user` compiles to `^(.*/)auth/v1/user$` — checked against
   playwright-core 1.62.1's own `globToRegexPattern`), so a URL carrying a query
   string was not matched. The pattern is a `RegExp` now, and the stub goes
   through `mockRoute` (§ 8), so a pattern that stops matching fails the case.
2. *The hook has nothing to call.* GoTrue then invokes `[auth.hook.send_email]`
   at `http://host.docker.internal:54321/functions/v1/auth-email`. There may be
   no `supabase_edge_runtime_project-running` container on this workstation at
   all — not even an exited one — so the hook times out, `updateUser` returns an
   error, and `pendingEmail` is never set. `docker ps -a | grep edge_runtime` is
   the one-line check; `supabase start` will not recreate a container the CLI
   thinks is already up, and a stale one boots into `failed to determine
   entrypoint` because it is bound to whichever worktree first created it. Only
   `supabase stop && supabase start` **from the worktree you want mounted**
   fixes it, which is a shared-resource action across every worktree — never do
   it while another lane is running.

Fixing (1) made the case hermetic: the stub answers the `PUT` itself, so (2) is
no longer on its path.

## Tests to add when the competitor-parity backlog lands

`docs/product/roadmap.md § Competitor-parity backlog` lists 12 features that aren't phased yet. When any of them ships, **the scope below is the minimum test surface** for that item to count as done. These are not nice-to-haves — they're the tests the CI job is expected to gate the PR on.

| Backlog feature | Pure-function tests | Integration / widget tests | Backend / schema tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| Training plan runner | Plan-to-workout expansion (given `plan_weeks + plan_workouts`, return today's workout for a given date + tz). VDOT-driven pace target generator. Adherence scorer (planned vs actual mileage). Structured-interval state machine (rep / recovery transitions). | Run-screen widget test: start a plan workout, simulate a completed run, assert the planned workout flips to "done" with side-by-side stats. | Migration: plan rows cascade-delete when a user deletes themselves; RLS: one user can't read another user's plan. |
| External platform sync | OAuth URL builder (per provider). Token refresh scheduler (given `token_expiry`, return next refresh time). Duplicate-run matcher (by `external_id` + timestamp fuzz). | Edge Function integration tests against a mock Strava/Garmin API; verify webhook → DB round-trip. | `integrations` RLS: users can't read other users' refresh tokens. |
| Segments + leaderboards | PostGIS line-matching stub (given two line-strings, return overlap fraction — pure SQL test with PostGIS fixtures). Effort-time computation from track slice. | Insert a run that crosses a segment → assert a `segment_effort` row appears. Leaderboard query returns correct ordering across a seeded fixture. | Segment RLS: private segments invisible to non-owners. |
| Heatmap / discovery | Tile-aggregation function: given N tracks, produce a tile's density array deterministically. Opt-out filter: a user's opt-out excludes their tracks from the aggregate. | Regression: a user who flips opt-out after aggregation no longer appears in next rebuild. | — |
| Trail / offline nav | Turn-cue generator: given a route + current position, produce the next-turn string. Offline-pack manifest: given a bounding box, list the tile URLs. | Widget test: step a simulated GPS trace along a route, assert the off-route banner fires at the correct threshold (the existing `live_run_map` tests would extend here). | — |
| Social graph | Follow-graph traversal (one hop). Feed query ordering (pinned runs, time-sorted, dedup). Kudos idempotency (second tap doesn't double-count). | Widget test: follow a user, navigate to feed, assert their latest run appears with correct kudos state. | `follows` RLS: a user can only create / delete their own follow row. Privacy-zone blur: start point returned as zone-center when viewer is not the owner. |
| Gear tracking | Mileage-total aggregation across a run set. Retirement-reminder trigger (given gear + threshold + current mileage). | Add gear → record a run with that gear selected → assert total updates; assert reminder fires at threshold. | Gear RLS: users only see their own gear. |
| Photos | Timestamp-to-waypoint matcher (given a photo EXIF time + a track, return the nearest waypoint). Thumbnail-URL generator. | Upload flow widget test: pick a photo, assert it appears on the run detail map pinned to the right location. | Storage bucket policy: anon can read thumbnails only if the run is public. |
| Audio-coached runs | Cue-schedule expander (given a workout + start time, emit cue events at the right offsets). Download manager: list expected assets for a workout; verify all-present check. | Record a run with an audio workout → assert the cue-schedule fired with the recorded elapsed times (mock the AudioCues emitter). | — |
| Race calendar + results | Race-proximity query (given lat/lng + radius, return races). Result-matching (given a run + a race, return confidence score). | Import a sample race → record a matching run → assert `race_results` row created and linked. | — |
| Advanced analytics | VDOT from a race result. Banister CTL/ATL/TSB from a week of runs. Race-time prediction from VDOT. Weekly mileage rollup (the existing `period_summary_test.dart` is the template). | Dashboard widget test: seed a fixture of runs, assert CTL/ATL curves render within tolerance. | — |
| Premium billing | Tier gate: given a `SubscriptionTier`, which features are enabled (pure data-driven). Webhook-payload parser (test against Stripe's fixture events). | Checkout flow e2e: click Upgrade → mock webhook → assert `subscription_tier` flips to `premium` on the profile within 5s. | Webhook replay-attack test: a re-posted event doesn't double-apply. Customer-portal link is user-scoped. |

### Conventions to keep

- Each new pure-function test file lives next to the code under `test/` in its package, matching the existing `run_stats_test.dart` pattern.
- SQL tests (RLS, PostGIS segment matching) go under `apps/backend/supabase/tests/` with `pgtap`; the `pgtap-rls` CI job runs them via `supabase test db --local`.
- Edge Function pure-helper tests use `deno test` and live next to the helper (`apps/backend/supabase/functions/_shared/*.test.ts` or `apps/backend/supabase/functions/<name>/lib.test.ts`). HTTP-level handler-envelope tests live at `apps/backend/supabase/functions/_shared/handler_envelope.test.ts` and need a running `supabase functions serve --env-file` — the `edge-functions` CI job sets this up.
- Widget tests use `WidgetTester.pumpWidget` + the existing synthetic-`Position` helpers from `test/helpers.dart`.
- No mocks for databases we control — local Supabase (54322) is the authoritative fixture. Mock only third-party HTTP (Strava, Stripe).
