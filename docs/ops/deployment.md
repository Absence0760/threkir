# Deployment overview

Where every service runs in production, who owns it, what it costs, and how it gets there.

This is the **plan**, not a record of what's already deployed. Most services are still local-only at the time of writing — the per-service docs spell out what's shipped vs. what's a forward-looking proposal. Update each section the moment something flips from "plan" to "live".

For the orthogonal "how a tag triggers a build" mechanics, see [releasing.md](releasing.md). For the strategic phase-by-phase architecture story, see [backend_scaling.md](../backend/backend_scaling.md). This file is the ops-side counterpart: where the bytes physically run.

## What runs where

| Service | Path | Provider | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Web app (static + Coach SSR) | `apps/web/` | **AWS** — S3 + CloudFront + Lambda Function URL + Route 53 (Terraform-provisioned, sops + AWS KMS for runtime secrets, OIDC-deployed) — see [decisions.md § 53](../architecture/decisions.md#53-web-app--domain-on-aws-s3--cloudfront--lambda--route-53-not-vercel-or-cloudflare-pages) | **Live** — threkir.com serves from CloudFront (verified 2026-07-20) |
| Backend (Postgres + Auth + Storage + Edge Functions) | `apps/backend/` | **Supabase Cloud** | **Live** — project `mcbgrgvegqcmdmtraikl`, East US (Ohio) |
| Job worker (Go) | `apps/job_worker/` | **Fly.io** (`threkir-worker`, region `ord`) — single machine, distroless; sited next to the Ohio Supabase project, not next to the team | **Live** — deployed 2026-07-21, queue draining + live hub serving (auth JWKS-verified, smoke matrix passed); client cutover pending (`PUBLIC_LIVE_HUB_URL` / `LIVE_HUB_URL` unset, so recorders/spectators still ride Supabase Realtime) |
| OSRM (map-matching engine) | `apps/job_worker/osrm/` | **Fly.io** (`osrm`, region `lhr`) — single machine + Volume | Plan |
| GraphHopper (`round_trip` route generator, `foot` profile) | `apps/job_worker/graphhopper/` | **Fly.io** (`graphhopper`, region `lhr`) — serves the "Generate a route by distance" loop endpoint; reached by the generate-route Lambda over public https with an `X-Engine-Key` Caddy guard | Plan |
| graph_cycle (v3 loop generator map sidecar) | `apps/graph_cycle/` | **Fly.io** (`graph-cycle`, region `lhr`) — distroless Go service, parses an OSM PBF into an in-memory foot graph; in-process `X-Engine-Key` guard | Plan |
| Coach LLM | `apps/web/src/routes/api/coach/+server.ts` (deployed as a Node 24 Lambda) | Anthropic Claude (default) — `OPENAI_BASE_URL` for self-host | Plan (web) |
| Mobile Android | `apps/mobile_android/` | **Google Play** — Internal → Beta → Production tracks | Plan |
| Mobile iOS | `apps/mobile_ios/` | **App Store Connect** — TestFlight → App Store | Plan |
| Wear OS | `apps/watch_wear/` | **Google Play** — separate listing (`com.threkir.watchwear`) | Plan |
| Apple Watch | `apps/watch_ios/` | Bundled inside the iOS app — no separate listing | Plan |
| RevenueCat | (third party) | RevenueCat dashboard — webhook to `apps/backend/supabase/functions/revenuecat-webhook` | Plan |
| MapTiler | (third party) | MapTiler Cloud — `PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY` shared by web + Wear OS | Plan |
| Anthropic API | (third party) | api.anthropic.com — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` reaches the coach Lambda as part of a KMS ciphertext the handler decrypts at cold start, never as a plaintext env var (Terraform reads it from the sops file in the private estate repo and encrypts it under the env's own CMK — [decisions § 1671](../architecture/decisions.md)) | Plan |

Per-service deep dives:

- [`apps/backend/deployment.md`](../../apps/backend/deployment.md)
- [`apps/web/deployment.md`](../../apps/web/deployment.md)
- [`apps/job_worker/deployment.md`](../../apps/job_worker/deployment.md) (covers the OSRM stack too)
- [`apps/mobile_android/deployment.md`](../../apps/mobile_android/deployment.md)
- [`apps/mobile_ios/deployment.md`](../../apps/mobile_ios/deployment.md) (covers Apple Watch bundling)
- [`apps/watch_wear/deployment.md`](../../apps/watch_wear/deployment.md)

Cross-service operator runbooks:

- [`apple_provisioning.md`](apple_provisioning.md) — every artifact the Apple Developer membership feeds (APNs, Sign in with Apple, distribution), in the only order that works, with a status ledger that is ticked as each step lands.
- [`google_provisioning.md`](google_provisioning.md) — the Google Cloud side of Google sign-in: the consent screen Google renamed to Google Auth Platform, the three OAuth clients, the Supabase provider and the two build-time gates. Same ledger shape; shares only the Supabase pages with its Apple sibling.

## Domain and DNS

Buy `threkir.com` (or whatever the brand ends up as) at one registrar. Recommended: Cloudflare Registrar (no markup, free DNSSEC) or Porkbun.

Subdomain map:

| Subdomain | Points at | TTL |
|---|---|---|
| `threkir.com` | Route 53 ALIAS → CloudFront distribution | 300 |
| `www.threkir.com` | Route 53 ALIAS → CloudFront distribution | 300 |
| `api.threkir.com` | Reserved for the Supabase custom domain (Pro + add-on) — **not provisioned on the current Free tier**; clients use the raw `<ref>.supabase.co` | 300 |
| `live.threkir.com` | CNAME → `threkir-worker.fly.dev` — the Go live spectator hub (TLS at Fly's edge via `flyctl certs add`) | 300 |
| `worker.threkir.com` | Not exposed publicly — internal Fly.io 6PN address only | — |
| `osrm.threkir.com` | Same — never publicly resolvable | — |

The Coach endpoint lives under `threkir.com/api/coach`; CloudFront routes that path to a Lambda Function URL while everything else hits the S3 origin. Same domain, same CORS posture as the static site — see [decisions.md § 53](../architecture/decisions.md#53-web-app--domain-on-aws-s3--cloudfront--lambda--route-53-not-vercel-or-cloudflare-pages).

**Email-from domain** (for transactional email — password resets, magic links): `noreply@threkir.com` via SendGrid or Resend. Configure SPF + DKIM + DMARC at the same DNS provider. Supabase's default `noreply@mail.app.supabase.io` works in dev but ends up in spam folders for half the population in prod.

## Cost ladder

Numbers are USD/month at the launch tier (1000 active users, ~5 runs/user/month). Update as we scale.

| Service | Tier | Monthly |
|---|---|---|
| AWS — S3 + CloudFront + Lambda + Route 53 | Free tier covers Lambda + most CF egress for year one; Route 53 hosted zone $0.50; S3 storage <$0.50; CF egress past free tier ~$0.085/GB | $1.50 → ~$5 |
| Supabase | Pro ($25) — required for daily backups, custom domain, larger compute | $25 |
| Fly.io — job_worker | shared-cpu-1x, 256 MB | $5 |
| Fly.io — OSRM | performance-2x, 8 GB RAM, 20 GB Volume | $30 |
| Fly.io — bandwidth | mostly internal 6PN (free); Storage egress goes through Supabase | <$5 |
| MapTiler Cloud | Free tier (100k tile reqs/mo) → paid ~$25 above | $0 → $25 |
| Anthropic API | Coach usage at ~$0.003 per chat turn × ~5k turns/mo | $15 |
| Domain | Cloudflare Registrar (.app cost) | ~$1.5 |
| Email (Resend) | Free tier 3k emails/mo → $20 above | $0 → $20 |
| Apple Developer Program | $99/year ÷ 12 | $8.25 |
| Google Play Console | $25 once (not recurring) | $0 |
| RevenueCat | Free up to $2.5k/mo MTR → 1% above | $0 → variable |

**Launch baseline: ~$70/month.** Scaling drivers (CloudFront egress past 1 TB once the free year ends, OSRM RAM as we add regions, Anthropic at higher coach usage) push that toward $200–300 in the 10k-user range. Detailed projections per service in each `deployment.md`.

**Cost-minimized launch:** to ship for a few dollars a month, [`deployment_lean.md`](deployment_lean.md) records which services to defer (the two Fly routing engines, the worker, mobile stores, coach) and why each degrades gracefully — a **Lean** tier (~$34–49/mo, Supabase Pro + worker, backups intact) and a **Rock-bottom** tier (~$3–4/mo, Supabase Free + web-only). Every deferral re-attaches later by setting one env var or standing up one Fly app.

**Cost-control ceilings (what stops a runaway):**

Each spend vector carries at least two independent caps — one in IaC, one (where possible) in the provider console:

- **AWS account total** — `aws_budgets_budget` in [`infra/envs/prod/budgets.tf`](../../infra/envs/prod/budgets.tf) fires at 50 % / 100 % ACTUAL and 100 % FORECASTED of `monthly_budget_limit_usd` (default $200). The FORECASTED notification is the one that catches a runaway *during* the month — ACTUAL lags by up to 24 h.
- **Lambda concurrency** — `lambda_reserved_concurrency` in [`infra/envs/{prod,preview}/main.tf`](../../infra/envs/prod/main.tf) caps per-env concurrency (prod 20, preview 5). Throttle alarms cover coach, generate-route and osrm-proxy; prod fires on the first throttled invocation (`lambda_throttle_alarm_threshold = 1`), preview at 5. Subscribed via `alert_emails` (validated non-empty + placeholder-rejected on both envs).
- **CloudFront edge cost** — `price_class = PriceClass_100` in [`infra/modules/web-stack/main.tf`](../../infra/modules/web-stack/main.tf) bills only NA + EU edge locations (skips SA + AU which 10× the per-GB cost). WAF `aws_wafv2_web_acl` rate-limits `/api/coach*` at 100 req / 5 min / IP via the scope-down filter — keeps static-asset traffic outside the rate-limit envelope.
- **CloudWatch log retention** — every log group sets `retention_in_days` ≤ 90 (default "Never expire" is $0.50/GB/month forever).
- **S3 lifecycle** — non-current versions expire at 30 d, incomplete multipart uploads abort at 7 d (prevents version-history cost ramp).
- **Coach per-user cap** — `TIER_LIMITS.free.dailyLimit` in [`apps/web/src/lib/coach/types.ts`](../../apps/web/src/lib/coach/types.ts) caps free at 2 messages/UTC-day, server-enforced before any Anthropic call. Pro is daily-uncapped but each turn is capped at `maxTokens = 2048`.
- **Anthropic console spend limit** — **MUST be set manually** at https://console.anthropic.com/settings/limits — code cannot enforce a provider-side ceiling on a key that's leaked from a sops file. The recommended floor is ~2× the projected monthly Anthropic spend (~$30/mo at launch baseline, so $60–$100 cap). **Set by hand 2026-09-18.** Nothing in this repo can confirm that — re-verifying it means opening the console, so treat the date as the record.
- **Supabase egress alert** — **MUST be set manually** in Supabase project settings. Code cannot enforce a daily-egress ceiling at the provider level.

The full audit + arch-guard tests covering each ceiling live in [`apps/web/src/lib/infra_guards.test.ts`](../../apps/web/src/lib/infra_guards.test.ts) under the "audit:cost-controls" section.

## Observability

The bar for v1 is: **someone gets paged when the site is down, can read the relevant logs, and can roll back without thinking.** Anything beyond that is nice-to-have.

| Surface | Tool | What we get | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Web (AWS) | CloudWatch Logs (Lambda) + CloudWatch Metrics + CloudWatch alarms | request volume, 4xx/5xx rate, cache hit ratio, Lambda p95 + cold-start rate | <$1/mo |
| Backend (Supabase) | Supabase Dashboard → Logs | Postgres slow queries, EF invocations, Auth events | included |
| Worker + OSRM (Fly.io) | `fly logs -a threkir-worker` / `fly logs -a osrm` + native metrics | per-machine CPU/RAM, restart history, log stream | included |
| Cross-service errors | **Sentry** — single org, separate projects per service | grouped exceptions, release tagging, breadcrumb trail on mobile | $0 (free tier) → $26 (team) |
| Uptime | **Better Stack** or **UptimeRobot** | external probe of `/`, `<ref>.supabase.co/rest/v1/…`, `threkir.com/api/coach` (HEAD-only — expect **405 + `Allow: POST`**, not a 2xx: the coach Lambda is POST-only since [decisions § 896](../architecture/decisions.md), and before that a HEAD answered 401. Either status is proof the function is alive; configure the monitor on the status, not on 2xx) | $0 (free tier) |
| RevenueCat / Stripe events | dashboards on each | subscription lifecycle, churn signals | included |

**Alerts that page someone** (Better Stack → email + push):

1. `threkir.com/` returns non-200 for >2 min
2. `<ref>.supabase.co/rest/v1/runs?select=count` returns non-200 for >2 min (proxy for "PostgREST is up + DB reachable + RLS still permits reads")
3. Worker hasn't claimed a job in >10 min while `jobs.status='queued'` count > 0 (worker stuck)
4. OSRM `/health` non-200 for >5 min
5. Sentry: any new error class with >10 events in 5 min

Not paging on:
- Single failed Edge Function call (transient, EF logs catch the trend)
- Single client-side JS error (Sentry rolls up; investigate on a schedule)
- Worker `defer_job` calls (those are the *correct* response to a transient)

### Synthetic checks on an API path assert `content-type`, not status

The distribution maps `403 -> 200 /200.html` for **every** origin at once —
`CustomErrorResponses` is a member of `DistributionConfig` and `CacheBehavior`
has no error-response member at all, so the API behaviours cannot opt out of it
([CloudFront API reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_CacheBehavior.html),
confirmed 2026-09-18). The mapping is load-bearing — every SPA deep link is a
missing S3 key, i.e. a 403 — and its cost is that **a refusal from any origin
reaches the caller as `200 text/html`**. No status-code check can tell that from
a working endpoint, which is how a malformed request read as a production outage
in September 2026 and produced a merged fix for a bug that did not exist (#938,
reverted by #941; [decisions § 1664](../architecture/decisions.md)).

`bin/preview-status.sh <env>` step 2 runs
[`scripts/probe_api_content_type.mjs`](../../scripts/probe_api_content_type.mjs),
which derives every `/api/*` cache behaviour from
`infra/modules/web-stack/main.tf` and asserts that each answers
`application/json` on both GET and POST. Every API Lambda in this tree answers
`application/json` for its refusals too, so an unauthenticated request is a
complete test. Run it against any deployed host on its own:

```bash
node scripts/probe_api_content_type.mjs --host threkir.com
node scripts/probe_api_content_type.mjs --derive   # offline; what CI runs
```

Two things follow for anyone adding an external monitor or debugging by hand:

- **An HTML body on an `/api/*` path is a masked 403, not a broken handler.**
  Check both CloudFront invoke grants on the function (`lambda:InvokeFunctionUrl`
  **and** `lambda:InvokeFunction`, issue #590) before looking at the code — a
  Function-URL refusal happens above the function, so there is no invocation,
  no `Errors` metric and no log line to find.
- **A POST through CloudFront must carry `x-amz-content-sha256`.** CloudFront
  signs the origin request with sigv4 and "Lambda doesn't support unsigned
  payloads"
  ([OAC for Lambda function URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-lambda.html)),
  so a POST without the viewer-supplied payload hash is refused at the origin
  and served as the shell. It is the caller's header, not something an origin
  request policy can add — #938 tried that and CloudFront refuses it.

## Backups and disaster recovery

| What | How | RTO | RPO |
|---|---|---|---|
| Postgres | **Free tier today: no automated backups** — periodic manual `pg_dump` until the Pro upgrade (Pro: daily backups, 7-day window; PITR closes the gap to ~5 min) | 30 min | last manual dump (Pro: 24 h → ~5 min with PITR) |
| Storage (`runs`, `route-files`, `run-photos`) | Supabase Storage built-in (object versioning is opt-in per bucket — turn it on for `runs`, leave off for `run-photos` to save cost) | 2 h | 24 h |
| OSRM graph | Reproducible — `make download && make build` against a Geofabrik PBF; ~15 min on the build machine. We do **not** back up the extracted graph. | 15 min | N/A (regenerable) |
| Worker state | Stateless — every claim is a fresh DB read. Restart loses nothing. | seconds | 0 |
| Mobile / watch local stores | User's device + Supabase row mirror. The local store is a cache, not a source of truth. | N/A | N/A |
| Web deployment artifact | Static build zip attached to each `web@*` GitHub Release; coach Lambda versions retained by AWS for rollback via the `live` alias. Redeploy by re-running the workflow against an older tag. | 5 min | per-deploy |

**RTO** = recovery time objective (how long to get back up). **RPO** = recovery point objective (max acceptable data loss).

Run a full restore drill **once per quarter**. The procedure (in [`apps/backend/deployment.md`](../../apps/backend/deployment.md) § Disaster recovery): take a fresh Supabase project, restore the latest backup into it, point a staging build at it, verify a smoke run. Without a drill, the backup is a fiction.

## Secrets management

Never commit a production secret. Three storage layers, in order of preference:

1. **Provider-native secret store** — Supabase Vault (already set up for OAuth tokens via `get_integration_tokens` / `set_integration_tokens` per [decisions.md § 41](../architecture/decisions.md#41-oauth-tokens-are-stored-in-supabase-vault-not-as-plaintext-columns)), AWS Secrets Manager (the coach Lambda's `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and server-side `SENTRY_DSN`), Fly.io secrets, GitHub Actions secrets. Scoped to the service that needs them.
2. **`.env.local` files** — gitignored, present on developer laptops and CI runners that need them. Templates committed as `.env.example`.
3. **The private estate secrets repo** (`Absence0760/infra-secrets`, sops + per-project AWS KMS — see the repo-root CLAUDE.md § Production secrets) — durable source of truth for long-lived key material that must survive a lost workstation (e.g. the Android upload keystore at `threkir/android-upload-keystore.sops.yaml`). Access is IAM (`kms:Decrypt`); Bitwarden holds the owner's interactive credentials. There is no 1Password anywhere in this estate.

The matrix of "what lives where":

| Secret | Origin | Stored in |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (`sb_secret_…`; legacy `service_role` JWT also accepted) | Supabase project settings | Fly.io secrets (worker) |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (publishable) | Supabase | GitHub Secrets (injected into web build at CI build-time as `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`); Mobile build configs |
| `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET` | Strava developer dashboard | Supabase Vault |
| `STRAVA_VERIFY_TOKEN`, `STRAVA_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | We invent | Supabase EF env |
| `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | RevenueCat dashboard | Supabase EF env |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic console | sops-encrypted in the private estate repo (AWS KMS key per env) — Terraform decrypts at apply time, RE-encrypts it into `aws_kms_ciphertext.coach`, and writes only that blob to the coach Lambda's `environment` block; the handler decrypts it once per cold start ([decisions § 1671](../architecture/decisions.md)) |
| `PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY` | MapTiler dashboard | GitHub Secrets (injected at CI build-time as `PUBLIC_*`); Mobile build configs |
| Android upload keystore | We generate once | GitHub Secrets (`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`) |
| iOS distribution `.p12` + provisioning profile | Apple Developer | GitHub Secrets (`IOS_BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` etc.) |
| Wear OS upload keystore | We generate once | GitHub Secrets (`WATCH_WEAR_KEYSTORE_BASE64`) |
| Play `service-account.json` | Google Cloud | GitHub Secrets (`PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`) |
| App Store Connect `.p8` API key | Apple Developer | GitHub `production` environment secret `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_PRIVATE_KEY` (the raw `.p8` text); backed up in the estate |

**Rotation rule**: if a secret is suspected leaked, the rotation is in three steps: (1) issue a new key in the provider, (2) update everywhere it's stored, (3) revoke the old key. Step 3 is what "the old one is dead" really means — without it the leaked key still works.

### Owed: move `STRAVA_WEBHOOK_SECRET` off the query string, then rotate it

**Status: open. Do this before the Strava webhook path is considered production-hardened.**

The Strava callback is registered as `https://<host>/…?secret=<STRAVA_WEBHOOK_SECRET>`, because Strava's subscription API accepts a callback **URL** and nothing else — there is no place to configure a header. A query-string secret is written verbatim into the receiver's request log on **every** delivery (Supabase function logs for the Edge Function, the worker's HTTP log for the Go endpoint), so anyone with log read access recovers it and can forge activity ingests into any user's `runs` by enumerable Strava athlete id.

Both receivers now also accept the secret from an `X-Webhook-Secret` header, preferred over the query param and compared in constant time on both paths (`apps/backend/supabase/functions/strava-webhook/index.ts`, `apps/job_worker/internal/stravahook/server.go`). That is the half that is code. The rest is operator work and must run **in this order**:

1. Confirm both receivers are deployed with header support (the Go worker is the production path; the Edge Function is the rollback path — **both**, or a rollback re-opens the hole).
2. Mint a new `STRAVA_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (≥ 32 chars — both receivers refuse below that floor).
3. Set the new value on the worker (Fly.io secret) and the Edge Function env, and **re-register the Strava subscription** with a callback URL that still carries `?secret=` set to the new value. Strava cannot send the header, so the query path stays live for Strava itself; the point of the rotation is that the value in the logs is no longer the one anything else trusts.
4. Revoke the old value — it is in every historical log line and must be treated as public from here on.
5. Any non-Strava caller of these endpoints (replay tooling, smoke tests, the manual recipes in [manual_testing.md](../testing/manual_testing.md)) switches to the header.

Until step 4 lands, treat the secret as compromised-if-logs-are: the channel is authenticated but not confidential. Recorded in [decisions.md § 567](../architecture/decisions.md).

**Operator scripts.** The AWS-side rotation flows are wrapped in [`bin/`](../../bin/README.md): `secret-set.sh <env> <KEY>` (rewrite a single sops-encrypted Lambda secret without opening an editor), `key-rotate.sh <env>` (re-encrypt under a new KMS key when the key itself is replaced), and `onboard-operator.sh <arn>` (grant a second human/role decrypt access on the env's KMS key). All take input via stdin / file / prompt — nothing routes secrets through argv or shell history.

**Lambda env rotations need an alias repoint.** An env-only `terraform apply` publishes a new Lambda version but the eight web Lambdas' `live` aliases are CI-owned and stay behind, still serving the previous version's frozen env — the rotated secret isn't live until the alias moves (issue #590 defect 2). Finish every web-Lambda env rotation with `bin/lambda-alias-sync.sh <env>` (or cut a `web@*` release, whose deploy repoints the aliases anyway).

---

## Merge gates — what protects `main`, and the one scanner that does not

Every deploy starts with a merge, so the merge gate is the first production
control. Branch protection on `main` requires **exactly one status context**:
`CI gate`, the aggregator job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It waits on the
other 35 jobs in that file and fails if any of them reports anything but
success or skipped.

`build-mobile-ios` joined the required set on 2026-09-20. It compiles
`apps/mobile_ios` for the iOS simulator (`flutter build ios --simulator
--no-codesign`, so no signing credential and no Apple Developer account are
needed) and runs the `RunnerTests` XCTest bundle. It is the only lane that
compiles the Flutter iOS target at all, and its XCTest step is the only place
in CI that launches the iOS binary -- `RunnerTests` is hosted by `Runner.app`,
so `AppDelegate` and `GeneratedPluginRegistrant` run for real and a plugin
whose iOS registration crashes at launch is caught. It is also the one
required job that does NOT take the broad `code` path filter. The cost is not
money -- this repo is public, so standard GitHub-hosted runners are free,
macOS included -- but ~15-20 min of wall clock against one of a small number
of concurrent hosted macOS runners, so it is gated on the `changes` job's `mobile_ios`
output and skips on a web-only, backend-only, firmware-only or docs-only PR.
A skip is a pass at the gate, so a green `CI gate` on such a PR means the iOS
target was not compiled -- which is correct, because nothing in that diff can
reach it.

A `needs:` entry is scoped to its own workflow, so a job in a sibling workflow
file can never be waited on directly. Two workflows reach the gate anyway by
being **called instead of triggered** -- `terraform.yml` ([decisions
§ 1149](../architecture/decisions.md)) and `gitleaks.yml` ([§
1264](../architecture/decisions.md)) are `on: workflow_call`, and `ci.yml` has
a one-line job for each. A called workflow's job results fan into the calling
job, so one `needs:` entry covers every job those files hold today and every
one they gain later.

**`gitleaks.yml` is called AND scheduled, and only the called half gates.** The
`workflow_call` path diffs against the base ref; the weekly `cron` is the only
scan that reads the whole of `main`'s history, and it reaches the gate by no
route at all -- it runs on no PR. It failed every week from 2026-05-18 to
2026-09-21 without that being visible anywhere ([decisions
§ 1697](../architecture/decisions.md)). `gitleaks-sweep.yml` now holds that cron, calls the same
scan, and opens a `secret-scan`-labelled issue on a failed sweep, closing it on
the next clean one -- the shape `audit.yml` already uses. It is a separate file
because a callee may not request a permission its caller lacks, and putting the
`issues: write` in `gitleaks.yml` failed `ci.yml` at startup. The issue carries the run link and never the
findings, because this repository is public. A red weekly sweep is therefore an
open issue rather than a merge block -- deliberately, since the history it
reads is already merged and blocking the next unrelated PR would not unmerge
it.

### What runs on a pull request and does not block it

Six workflows trigger on a pull request and reach nothing the gate waits for.
Each is a decision rather than a backlog item, and the decisions live in code:
`PR_ADVISORY` in
[`scripts/check_ci_diagnostics.mjs`](../../scripts/check_ci_diagnostics.mjs)
holds one entry each with the reason folding it into `ci.yml` would be the
**wrong** answer rather than the unmade one, and that guard's rule 7 fails the
PR when a pull-request-triggered workflow is in neither the gate nor the
register. Rule 8 compares the list below against the register in both
directions, so this section cannot quietly drift out of step with the code the
way a hand-maintained duplicate does -- a name here that the register has
dropped, or an entry there this list never mentions, fails `workflow-lint`.

- `security.yml` -- CodeQL's `analyze` declares no severity threshold, so a
  fold would gate on the analysis completing rather than on what it found. The
  section below is entirely about this one.
- `pr-title-lint.yml` -- it triggers on `edited`, which is how a corrected
  title re-lints. `ci.yml` carries no `types:` and deliberately not that one,
  since `edited` rebuilds every job on a description typo.
- `compliance-drift.yml` -- advisory by construction: it runs in warn mode and
  asks a human whether a doc applies to the diff, which is a judgement rather
  than a verdict.
- `labeler.yml` -- it labels a pull request and asserts nothing about it, so
  there is no verdict for a gate to wait on.
- `dependabot-auto-merge.yml` -- it ACTS on a pull request (approve + enable
  auto-merge) rather than checking one, and a required check that merges the PR
  it is required by is a cycle.
- `pr-mergeable.yml` -- it reports when `ci.yml` has **not run at all**, which
  is the state a PR with conflicts is in: no merge ref exists, so no run is
  created, and the two `pull_request_target` checks that do survive read as
  health. Folding it into `ci.yml` would give it `ci.yml`'s fate and silence it
  exactly when it has something to say. Not gating on it is right on its own
  terms too -- `CI gate` is already absent on such a PR, so branch protection
  already blocks the merge; this adds a signal to a reader, not a second lock
  ([§ 1686](../architecture/decisions.md)).

The register carries each reason in full; the list above is the operator's
index into it. All six go red on a finding and the PR merges anyway, so a red
row from any of them is read rather than waited for. The root `CLAUDE.md` says
the same about `pr-title-lint.yml`'s `lint title` in the words a contributor
meets it in, and rule 8 pins that sentence too.

There is a third option for `lint title` and it is deliberately not taken:
adding it to the required-status-check set is a repo setting, and it is cheap
(the job is ~20 s and depends on nothing). It stays out because the required set
being **exactly one context** is a property worth more than this check --
`ci.yml` is the one place a job's red is guaranteed to block, and every other
guard in this repo has been folded into it rather than added beside it
([§ 1149](../architecture/decisions.md), [§ 1264](../architecture/decisions.md)).
A second context would make "what blocks a merge" a question with two answers,
one of them invisible to every guard in the tree. A bad PR title is caught by a
red row and fixed with a retitle; that is the trade
([§ 1585](../architecture/decisions.md)).


### CodeQL is the exception, and it is a repo setting

`security.yml`'s four CodeQL analyses and two Trivy jobs are **not** in the
gate, so a CodeQL alert on a pull request does not block its merge today. The
call trick above does not fix it, for a reason measured rather than assumed:
`github/codeql-action/analyze` at the pinned SHA declares 18 inputs and not one
of them is a severity threshold (re-read against the action's own `action.yml`
2026-09-06). An alert never turns the job red, so calling `security.yml` from
`ci.yml` would gate on the analysis **completing**, not on what it found -- and
it would re-key every analysis in the Security tab, because the action derives
its analysis key from the *run's* workflow path.

What actually gates a CodeQL finding is a repo setting, and only a repo
setting. In **Settings -> Rules -> Rulesets** (or Branch protection) on `main`,
enable the **code scanning results** requirement and add the `CodeQL` tool at
the alert threshold you want. Leave the required *status check* set at exactly
`CI gate`; do **not** add the four `analyze` job names to it as a substitute,
because that gates on the scan running rather than on what it found. Adding
them is still worth doing if the worry is a scanner that silently stops
working -- a broken extractor or a bad `queries:` value fails those jobs, and
nothing else in CI would notice -- but it is a different guarantee, not a
weaker version of the same one.

Re-derived against the action's own `action.yml` at the pinned SHA on
2026-09-06 rather than inherited from the paragraph above: 18 inputs
(`check_name`, `output`, `upload`, `cleanup-level`, `ram`, `add-snippets`,
`skip-queries`, `threads`, `checkout_path`, `ref`, `sha`, `category`,
`upload-database`, `post-processed-sarif-path`, `wait-for-processing`, `token`,
`matrix`, `expect-error`), and not one is a severity or alert threshold. The
conclusion stands.

**Part of the "scanner silently stops working" worry is now inside the gate,
and it is the part that has actually happened.** Twice a compiled leg reported
clean over source it had never read -- `apps/graph_cycle`
([§ 1304](../architecture/decisions.md)) and 11 Kotlin files under
`apps/mobile_android/android` ([§ 1352](../architecture/decisions.md)) -- because
CodeQL scopes a compiled language to whatever the build steps compile, and a
database holding one tree looks exactly like one holding two. Neither would have
been caught by requiring the `analyze` jobs to pass, because in both cases they
DID pass. `scripts/check_codeql_coverage.mjs` runs in `workflow-lint`, which is
in the gate, and fails the PR when a build step stops covering a tree the repo
holds. What is still outside the gate is a leg that fails outright or a bad
`queries:` value -- loud states, unlike the silent one.

Folding `security.yml` into `ci.yml` the way `terraform.yml` and `gitleaks.yml`
were folded would buy the rest of that second guarantee without a repo setting,
and it has been re-derived and declined three times now, so the cost is recorded
here to stop a fourth: the fold re-keys all four analyses (the action derives
its key from the run's workflow path), and `security.yml`'s own `push` and
`pull_request` triggers would have to be removed at the same time or every merge
runs the analyses twice and two uploads to one SARIF category make the alert set
flip-flop -- the exact failure `security.yml`'s header records being merged to
escape. It is a real option, not a foreclosed one; it is just not free, and it
is not the option that gates a FINDING.

Two things to do at the same time as the setting, because nothing in the repo
can observe it:

- The required set stops being exactly one context. The root `CLAUDE.md`
  ("must pass the single required **CI gate** status check") and this section
  both say it is, and both become wrong the moment the rule is enabled.
- Trivy stays advisory on purpose and is not part of this. Both container jobs
  run at `exit-code: '0'` and report to the Security tab; that is a deliberate
  call recorded in `security.yml`, not an oversight to sweep up here.

Nothing in this repository can read, set, or verify any of the above -- branch
protection is not readable by the workflow token -- so this section is the only
record that the state was ever intended.

### A merged PR's branch is deleted on merge

**Automatically delete head branches** (`delete_branch_on_merge`) is on as of
2026-09-16. It had been off, and 211 remote branches of merged PRs had piled up
by then. They were deleted the same day, each one pushed with
`--force-with-lease` on the head the PR merged, so nothing pushed after a merge
could go with it.

Two things follow for stacked PRs. Merging a parent **retargets** its open
children onto the parent's base rather than closing them ([GitHub,
2020-05-19](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-05-19-pull-request-retargeting/)).
That retarget is an `edited` event, and no `ci.yml` job runs on `edited`, so a
child whose parent just merged has to be pushed to before it gets a gate run.
The child is also still carrying the parent's commits, not the squash `main`
now holds, so merge `origin/main` into it as the root `CLAUDE.md` describes.

The setting leaves two kinds of branch alone: the branch of a PR that was
closed without merging, and a branch that never had a PR. On 2026-09-16 there
were 16 and 20 of those. They were left for whoever owns them. Like branch
protection, the setting is invisible from inside the tree, so this paragraph is
the only record of it.

### One red gate is not the pull request's fault, and it has no fix here

The gate can go red on a change with nothing wrong with it. The known case is
[issue #916](https://github.com/Absence0760/threkir/issues/916): the local
Supabase stack's edge runtime exits **135 (SIGBUS)** while serving the first
request it gets, which is the `start-supabase` action's own readiness probe, so
a Playwright shard fails before a test runs and reports
`edge runtime (clip-public-track) never became ready`. Three occurrences since
2026-09-08, all on `ubuntu-latest`. The cause is upstream and unfixed: the
runtime carries a copy of Deno's cache layer that deletes a cache database
another connection still has mapped, and no released edge-runtime image has
taken [denoland/deno#34873](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/34873), which
fixed it. Nothing in this repo can close it — the CLI pin cannot move to an
image with the same bug, and both levers that would turn the check green
(a wider budget, an automatic restart on 135) would hide a live crash.

**Operator action: re-run the failed job.** Do not treat it as the branch's
failure and do not chase it as a flaky test.
[decisions § 1663](../architecture/decisions.md) holds the evidence and the
one-command check that says when the pin can move.

## Release vs deploy

Two orthogonal axes. **Release** is "we cut a tagged version of the product"; **deploy** is "those bytes are now serving traffic". They overlap in different ways per service. Every `release-*.yml` deploy is **triggered by publishing a GitHub Release** for the tag below (a bare tag push no longer deploys — the published Release is the gate; see [releasing.md](releasing.md)):

| Service | Release tag | Deploy means |
|---|---|---|
| Web | `web@*` | CI builds → `aws s3 sync` to the prod bucket → `aws cloudfront create-invalidation` → `aws lambda update-function-code` for the coach handler. Live within ~60 s of CI success. |
| Backend (migrations + EF) | `backend@*` | Migrations applied + EFs uploaded to the linked Supabase project |
| Job worker | `worker@*` | `release-worker.yml` → `flyctl deploy --remote-only` against the `job_worker` Fly app |
| OSRM | `osrm@*` | `release-osrm.yml` → `flyctl deploy` against the `osrm` Fly app (image only — the graph rides along on the Volume); separate from the worker because it has different rebuild/restart cadences |
| graph_cycle | `graph-cycle@*` | `release-graph-cycle.yml` → `flyctl deploy` against the `graph-cycle` Fly app (the OSM PBF persists on the `graph_cycle_data` Volume; redeploy reparses it on boot) |
| GraphHopper | none | No release workflow yet — still a hand-rolled `flyctl deploy` against the `graphhopper` Fly app from a maintainer's laptop |
| Mobile Android | `mobile_android@*` | `.aab` uploaded to Play Internal track; manual promotion to Beta/Production from the Console |
| Mobile iOS | `mobile_ios@*` | `.ipa` uploaded to TestFlight; manual promotion to App Store from App Store Connect |
| Wear OS | `watch_wear@*` | `.aab` uploaded to Play Internal track for the separate Wear listing |

Tag → workflow → deploy is the canonical path for every Fly service, GraphHopper included — `release-graphhopper.yml` fires on a published `graphhopper@*` release, so no service is left on a hand-rolled `flyctl deploy` from a maintainer's laptop. See [`apps/job_worker/deployment.md`](../../apps/job_worker/deployment.md) § CI wiring.

### One-off: the SPA-shell cutover from `index.html` to `200.html`

adapter-static's `fallback` moves from `build/index.html` to `build/200.html`
so the prerendered landing page can occupy `build/index.html`. CloudFront's
403 -> shell `custom_error_response` is what serves every deep link (each
dynamic client route is a missing S3 key, so S3 answers 403 and the
distribution substitutes the shell at 200), so the mapping has to follow the
shell to its new name or every deep link serves the landing page instead of
the app.

**Neither single-step order is safe.** Apply the Terraform first and
`/200.html` is a key the bucket does not hold, so a deep link 403s into a
second 403. Deploy the tag first and `/index.html` is the landing page, so a
deep link serves marketing at 200. Both windows last until the other half
lands.

**Three steps, in this order, close both windows** (derived from the workflow
and the Terraform, never executed against AWS -- no lane holds credentials):

1. `aws s3 cp s3://<bucket>/index.html s3://<bucket>/200.html` -- pre-seed the
   CURRENT shell under its new name. The default `--copy-props default` copies
   `content-type` and `cache-control` from the source object, so the copy is
   byte- and header-identical to what a deploy would have written.
2. `terraform apply` the `custom_error_response` change in
   [`infra/envs/<env>`](../../infra/README.md). `/200.html` now resolves to the
   shell deep links were already being served, so nothing about them changes.
3. Publish the `web@*` release. `index.html` becomes the landing page and
   `200.html` the new shell, both in the same `aws s3 sync` pass, and the
   workflow's closing `create-invalidation --paths "/*"` clears any cached
   error-response body rather than waiting out a TTL.

Between 1 and 3 the pre-seeded object cannot be swept: the deploy's first
`aws s3 sync` runs `--delete` but excludes `*.html`, and the CLI's own
reference states that "files excluded by filters are excluded from deletion".
The same two filter rules are why the sync needs no edit for the new file --
pass 2's `--exclude "*" --include "*.html"` matches `200.html` on
last-match-wins, so it uploads with the 60 s HTML cache like any other page.

**The code half is landed; the three steps are all that is left.** When this
section was written the repo was mid-move and the paragraph here warned that
the five share Lambdas still embedded `build/index.html` at bundle time, so
step 3 would bake the landing page into every share handler whatever the
ordering. That is no longer the state. Verified in the tree: `svelte.config.js`
emits `fallback: "200.html"`, all five `apps/web/lambda/share-*/build.mjs`
resolve `build/200.html`, `spa_shell_head_signals.test.ts` reads that artifact,
and the `custom_error_response` in `infra/modules/web-stack/main.tf` names
`/200.html`. `apps/web/src/lib/seo/spa_shell_filename.test.ts` derives the
expected name from the adapter config and fails the PR if any of those rails
drifts back, so the code cannot regress under the operator ([decisions
§ 1272](../architecture/decisions.md)).

**Which environment is this?** The steps are per-distribution and `prod` and
`preview` are cut over independently. To find out whether an environment has
already been through them, read the live mapping rather than assuming:

```
aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id <DIST_ID> --query 'DistributionConfig.CustomErrorResponses.Items[?ErrorCode==`403`].ResponsePagePath' --output text
```

`/index.html` means the cutover has not happened on that distribution and the
next `web@*` release will break every deep link on it; `/200.html` means steps
1 and 2 are done. `aws s3 ls s3://<bucket>/200.html` answers step 1 on its own.

**The claim that was derived is now measured, on `prod`, 2026-09-10.** It used
to read that none of this had been executed against AWS, because no lane holds
credentials. The step carrying the most weight was that the pre-seeded
`200.html` survives the release's `aws s3 sync --delete`, resting on excluded
keys not being deletion candidates. It does. `prod` was walked through all three
steps in order and `web@1.5.0` published on top: the pre-seed survived the
release, and pass 2 then overwrote it with the new build's shell in the same
run. Deep links were checked after the deploy and came back byte-identical to
`200.html` rather than serving the landing page, which is the failure this
ordering exists to prevent.

Two facts worth carrying forward. `index.html` and `200.html` genuinely diverge
after the cutover -- the landing page measured 15098 bytes against the shell's
5927 -- so the rollback note below is load-bearing rather than theoretical. And
`preview` has not been cut over, because it does not exist: the account holds
one distribution, and `preview.threkir.com` resolves to nothing. The per-
environment framing above still stands for whenever that environment is built.

Rollback is the mirror image: revert the Terraform first (the bucket still
holds an `index.html`, though after a post-cutover deploy it is the landing
page, so re-seed it from `200.html` before reverting), then redeploy the
previous tag.

## Pre-flight checklist before going live

Before flipping any service from "Plan" to live in the table at the top:

1. The per-service `deployment.md` is up to date — provider, region, instance size, command to deploy.
2. Secrets are loaded (provider-native + GitHub Actions where the workflow needs them).
3. DNS records resolve from a few networks.
4. An uptime probe is configured.
5. A rollback path is verified — actually run it once against a staging deploy.
6. Update the row at the top of this file from "Plan" to "Live (region)".
7. Tick the corresponding box in [roadmap.md](../product/roadmap.md).
8. If this enables a feature, flip the cell in [parity.md](../product/parity.md).

### Lambda secrets — one apply, before the next web deploy

[decisions § 1671](../architecture/decisions.md) moved the coach and
generate-route credentials out of their Lambda environments and into a KMS
ciphertext the handler decrypts at cold start. The code is on `main` and the
guard enforces it; the change is **unapplied and unplanned** — no lane in this
repo holds AWS credentials, so `terraform plan` has never run against real
state. Do this under the operator's own SSO profile, preview first:

1. `terraform plan` in `infra/envs/preview`. Expect two new
   `aws_kms_ciphertext` resources and, on `threkir-web-preview-coach` and
   `-generate-route`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` /
   `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GRAPHHOPPER_API_KEY` / `GRAPH_CYCLE_API_KEY` **leaving**
   the environment and `SECRETS_CIPHERTEXT` + `SECRETS_CONTEXT` arriving.
   `kms_key_arn` must NOT appear on any function — that is a different design
   and it hands the plaintext back (§ 1021 and claim 9 in
   `scripts/check_infra_iam.mjs`).
2. Apply, then deploy the matching web bundle. **Order matters in one
   direction only**: the new code refuses to serve without a bag, so applying
   before the code lands is safe (the old code ignores the blob) and shipping
   the code before the apply is a 503 on `/api/coach` and
   `/api/routes/generate` until the apply completes.
3. Verify the environment no longer carries a key:
   `aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name threkir-web-preview-coach --query 'Environment.Variables' | grep -c API_KEY` must be `0`.
4. Verify the decrypt works end to end — one `/api/coach` turn on a cold
   container. An `AccessDeniedException` in the function's log means the
   execution role lost its `kms:Decrypt` on the env's secrets CMK.
5. Repeat for `prod`. Rotating a secret afterwards is `bin/secret-set.sh` **plus
   a re-apply** — the blob is a resource, so a function holding the old one
   decrypts the old value.

### Legal pages — before public launch

The legal pages (`/privacy`, `/terms`, `/cookie-notice`, `/health-data-notice`, plus the
store-facing `/delete-account` instructions page — decisions §247) are complete text
(decisions §243); what remains is operator work, not code:

1. Counsel review of the four pages (plus the docs under `docs/compliance/`).
2. Fill the operator facts in `apps/web/src/lib/legal/operator.ts` — registered postal address and
   governing-law state; the pages' "pending" lines disappear on their own.
3. Appoint the Art 27 EU + UK representatives (vendors + process in
   [docs/compliance/eu-representative.md](../compliance/eu-representative.md)) and fill them in the
   same file.
4. Create the `dmca@threkir.com` mailbox/alias and register the DMCA agent with the US Copyright
   Office (the Terms already name the address).
5. Confirm each sub-processor DPA is executed (list in
   [docs/compliance/sub-processors.md](../compliance/sub-processors.md)).
6. Enter `https://threkir.com/delete-account` as the **Delete account URL** in the Play Console
   Data safety form (and as the account-deletion link in App Store Connect). The page is live and
   pinned by `tests-e2e/legal/pages.spec.ts`; this item is just the console data entry.
