# custom_watch — AI session notes

**Pure Rust + Embassy firmware** for an ultra-marathon-optimised wrist device
research prototype. Targets the Nordic nRF52840 DK at tier 1. Not Flutter,
not Kotlin, not Zephyr — see
[../../docs/architecture/decisions.md § 80](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md#80-tier-1-firmware-uses-embassy-on-rust-on-the-nordic-nrf52840--chosen-for-memory-safety-tooling-and-async-ergonomics-not-for-performance)
for why.

## Scope — read before writing code

**This is research-tier, owner-personal investigation. Not a product.** See
[../../docs/architecture/decisions.md § 71](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md#71-own-hardware-an-ultra-marathon-watch-stays-research-only-watch-development-is-deferred-indefinitely)
(the original deferral) and its 2026-05-28 amendment (permits tier-1 bench-
prototype firmware code on owner-personal evenings-and-weekends, nothing
more). Everything in this directory is **research scaffolding** — not a
green-lit app SKU, not a roadmap line item, not customer-facing.

**Long-term goal: [§ 92](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md#92-custom-watch-decisions-optimise-for-tier-3-production-quality-period--scope-and-effort-are-not-constraints) — "build the best watch ever".**
The tier-1 scope above is a deliberate first-prototype compromise per the
[§ 92 Resolution](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md#resolution-2026-05-28--hybrid--92-long-term-goal---80-tier-1-preserved-as-deliberate-first-prototype-compromise):
keep tier-1 costs down + get a working version first, with the
understanding that tier-2 migrates to Apollo510B silicon per
[§ 90](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md#90-bom-refresh-2026-05-28--apollo510b--bmp581-swap-ins-supply-alternates-qualified)
and the full Phase 0–5 optimal road follows from there. **Tier-2+ decisions
are governed by § 92's "optimal regardless of effort/scope" rule**, which
supersedes § 86's "even at small margins" framing. If you're about to make
a tier-2+ decision while reading this file, use § 92 as the lens; § 86's
exception clause for "tier-current-only choices that get rewritten anyway"
no longer applies.

**Build here:**

- Tier-1 bench-prototype Rust firmware: Embassy tasks, hand-rolled drivers
  for the Sharp MIP / MAX30101 / u-blox NMEA breakouts that don't have
  community Rust crates, GATT-server bring-up via `nrf-softdevice`.
- Firmware-architecture work that ports forward to production silicon:
  DMA-driven I/O, async tasks, coprocessor-split design, partial display
  updates, aggressive sleep. See
  [../../docs/custom_watch/performance_path.md](../../docs/custom_watch/performance_path.md)
  for which patterns matter at tier 2+ and which don't move the needle.
- Driver crates under `drivers/<sensor>/` that we'd reuse if we ever ported
  to a custom PCB. Independently testable, no `app/` dependencies.
- Host-side unit tests (`cargo test`) for any pure-logic crate (NMEA
  parser, recording state machine, signal-processing helpers).
- A **3D-printed tier-1 enclosure** — a functional FDM chassis that holds
  the breakout boards + LiPo together and takes a Velcro strap so the unit
  is wearable for a test jog. This is a tier-1 deliverable per
  [../../docs/custom_watch/prototyping.md](../../docs/custom_watch/prototyping.md#tier-1--bench-prototype-5002k-36-months);
  ~$0–50 per print, any hobby printer or Shapeways / JLCPCB 3D. It is *not*
  case CAD (see the exclusion below) — a board-holder, not industrial
  design, no sealing, no IPX claim.

**Don't build here:**

- PCB CAD, schematic files, EAGLE / KiCad projects, case CAD, gerbers.
  These are tier-2+ work and remain gated on the three §71 triggers
  (paying user base, ODM approach, hardware co-founder). The 2026-05-28
  amendment did *not* lift this. **"Case CAD" here means
  industrial-design / sealed-enclosure / IPX-tooling work — *not* the
  functional 3D-printed board-holder chassis listed under "Build here",
  which is an allowed tier-1 deliverable.**
- RF antenna designs, IPX certification testing, FCC / CE pre-compliance
  scans, drop tests. Also tier-2+.
- C / Zephyr code. The §80 decision picked Rust + Embassy; the fallback
  to Zephyr is documented in §80 but takes effect only if we hit a
  blocking driver issue that takes more than two weeks to resolve in Rust.
- Anything that implies the watch is a shipping product — marketing copy,
  product-page work, App Store / Play Store metadata, customer-facing
  documentation. The repo has none of that for this directory and
  shouldn't acquire any until §71 triggers flip.
- Schema-synced row types. No `generated/db_rows.rs` exists — the watch
  never writes Supabase rows directly. **Note (2026-07-08, [§ 211](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md)):**
  the owner overrode the tier-2 gate to build the finished-run sync
  vertical now (watch flash store → BLE `run_manifest`/`run_chunk` →
  phone reformats the `watch_core::run_store` wire blob → the existing
  `WatchIngestQueue`/`runFromWatchPayload` → `api.saveRun`). That reuses
  the shipped phone→Supabase path with **zero backend/schema change**, so
  it still needs no generated row types on the watch. The BLE side stays
  behind the `ble` feature and is compile-verified only.
- Anything that pioneers a product feature not yet on web. Per
  [`../../docs/architecture/decisions.md` § 24](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md#24-web-is-the-canonical-feature-surface-mobile-and-watches-are-platform-additive),
  web is the canonical feature surface for the product. Firmware here
  is for *bench-prototype investigation of the hardware path*, not for
  proving out new product features (a novel recording-algorithm variant,
  a different training-load model, a coach behaviour the web app doesn't
  have). Pioneering happens on web first — same rule as the other watch
  apps.

## Host tests — the current figure, and where NOT to read one

`watch_core` carries **2445 host tests in `watch_core`** today: the `#[test]`
fns across the 111 modules `core/src/lib.rs` declares. That is the number
`check_watch_doc_counts.mjs` re-derives on every PR, so it is the one to quote.
Re-measure the runtime figure with
`cd apps/custom_watch && cargo test --target "$(rustc -vV | sed -n 's|host: ||p')" -p watch_core`
— its lib line reads `running <n> tests`, and it agrees with the guard's count
exactly (both 2428 on 2026-09-05), which is what makes the static derivation
trustworthy. The whole-workspace sweep is a different, larger population:
`bin/watch-test.sh` (2,868 passed / 0 ignored, measured 2026-09-05), and no
guard holds that one — it needs cargo.

**Do not take a count out of a dated batch note.** `README.md`'s chronology and
`docs/custom_watch/tier1_log.md` record what was true on the day of each batch
and are deliberately excluded from the doc-count guard ([decisions § 793](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md)):
rewriting them would misdescribe the batch they describe. Their figures are
as-of, not current.

For status + next-steps + the active workspace layout, see
[`README.md`](README.md) in this directory.
