/// Process-wide singleton holding live recording state. Owned by

/// (which only reads + emits user-action callbacks back through the
/// service). Decoupling recording from UI lifecycle is what lets a
/// run survive the activity being destroyed for ambient, screen off,
/// or low memory.

/// The full GPS track is *not* held here — it's streamed to disk by
/// `TrackWriter`. Only the latest point (for map/UI display) and a
/// count live in `Metrics`. This is what lets a 10-hour run fit in
/// constant memory instead of growing linearly with every GPS fix.
