/**
 * /runs[id] — the NON-OWNER branch (issue #666).
 *
 * `fetchRunById` is owner-scoped (`.eq('user_id', userId)`) because it is
 * the only read path that downloads the UNCLIPPED GPS track. For a long
 * time that meant the canonical signed-in run surface rendered "Run not
 * found" for every run the viewer didn't own — including a PUBLIC run by
 * a runner they follow, which RLS would have let them read. Commenting on
 * someone else's run had no reachable surface but /share/run/[id], which
 * is why the cross-user comment + kudos specs all navigate there.
 *
 * The page now resolves entitlement through the `public_runs` view
 * (is_public = true) and mounts RunShareView for a non-owner, so the
 * signed-in path works and carries kudos + comments. What this spec pins:
 *
 *   1. alex opens runner's PUBLIC run at /runs/[id] → the run renders with
 *      attribution, and the comment composer is there (the capability the
 *      finding said had no surface).
 *   2. the comment alex posts through that composer lands in the DB with
 *      author = alex — the real path, not a /share/run detour.
 *   3. NO owner chrome renders: no visibility chip, no Edit, no Delete run.
 *      Those all live inside the owner branch of the template.
 *   4. a PRIVATE run by runner still lands on the not-found state for
 *      alex. Entitlement is the public_runs row, not merely "not mine".
 *
 * The clipped-track half of the contract (a non-owner track on THIS
 * surface must come through the clip-public-track Edge Function) is pinned
 * as SURFACE 5 of cross-cutting/privacy-zone-clipping-journey.spec.ts,
 * where the privacy-zone fixture already lives.
