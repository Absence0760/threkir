// Source-level claims about `apps/watch_ios` that no compiler in this repo's
// Linux CI can make.
//
// The watchOS tier is the least verifiable thing in the monorepo. Exactly one
// job compiles it — `test-watch-ios`, on a macOS runner — and every other
// claim about it rests on reading. `apps/watch_ios/scripts/check_xcstrings_parity.sh`
// already holds the String Catalog against its two locale-declaration sites
// (decisions § 761 / § 850). This guard holds the *other* things about the
// tier that a bare `node` on Linux can honestly measure, each of which fails
// in a way no Swift test and no `xcodebuild` run would report. They are
// numbered below and the run prints one `ok:` line per claim, so the count
// lives in the output rather than in a sentence that goes stale — it said
// "seven" while there were thirteen:
//
//   (1) Every string literal handed to a localizing SwiftUI / Foundation API
//       has a String Catalog entry. A literal with no entry is NOT a build
//       error and NOT a crash: `LocalizedStringKey` falls back to the key, so
//       the watch renders English in every locale and everything passes. The
//       cost lands later and elsewhere — the next Xcode build extracts the
//       literal into the catalog as a new untranslated key, and *then* the
//       parity guard fails a PR that never touched localization.
//
//   (2) Every String Catalog entry is still referenced by some Swift literal.
//       A key orphaned by a UI change is six translations nobody will delete,
//       and it makes the catalog's size a lie about the app's surface.
//
//   (3) Every capability the Swift exercises is declared in `Info.plist` /
//       `WatchApp.entitlements`, and every declaration is claimed by code —
//       both directions, mirroring `check_ios_native_declarations.mjs`, which
//       does exactly this for the phone and reads nothing under
//       `apps/watch_ios`. A missing purpose string makes watchOS deny the
//       permission silently; an over-declared capability is an App Review
//       rejection and a privacy over-claim.
//
//   (4) RETIRED, and the number is left vacant so every claim below still
//       answers to the number it has always had. It held the complication's
//       byte-identical second copy of `formatElapsed` / `formatDistanceKm` /
//       `formatPaceSecPerKm` against `RunFormat.swift`'s, because a text
//       compare was the only thing that could: the copies compiled into two
//       different modules and no Swift test could link both. There is one
//       copy now. `RunFormat.swift` and `Complications/ActiveRunTimeline.swift`
//       are members of the `WatchAppComplication` extension AND of `WatchApp`,
//       the way `ActiveRunBridge.swift` already was, so the watch face and
//       `WatchAppTests` run the same source. Nothing replaces the claim
//       because the drift it watched for no longer has two places to happen
//       in: dropping a shared file from one target's membership is a missing
//       symbol, which is a compile error in whichever project dropped it, not
//       a silent divergence — and claim (15) holds the two projects' `WatchApp`
//       membership lists against each other besides.
//
//   (5) The App Group identifier in `ActiveRunBridge.swift` matches the one
//       `Complications/README.md` instructs an operator to type into Xcode. A
//       mismatch there is a shared container that silently never binds.
//
//   (6) Every key the watch packs into the `WCSession.transferFile` metadata
//       envelope is lifted back out by the phone's `WatchIngestBridge.swift`,
//       and vice versa. Both ends are hand-written key lists in two different
//       apps, and the drift has already happened once: the Apr 2026
//       cross-client audit found Apple-Watch runs landing on the phone with no
//       `activity_type`. Nothing fails when a key is dropped — the run syncs,
//       one column short.
//
//   (7) The same, for the envelope going the OTHER way on the same session:
//       the route the phone arms on the wrist. Three hand-written key lists in
//       three languages and three apps — `apple_watch_route_bridge.dart` names
//       them as method-channel arguments, `WatchIngestBridge.routeUserInfo`
//       lifts those out and repacks them for `transferUserInfo`, and
//       `ArmedRoute.decode` reads them back on the watch. Every rejection in
//       that chain drops the WHOLE push (a partly-decoded polyline is worse
//       than none), so a key renamed on one rail is a route the runner arms on
//       the phone that silently never reaches the wrist — with a success
//       reported at the point they armed it.
//
//  (7b) The LIST that rides the same envelope — `saved_routes`, the starred
//       set the wrist's route picker offers. It is a third key list on each of
//       claim (7)'s three rails, so it can drift from them and from each
//       other. What holds it is not a fourth transcription: both Swift ends
//       DELEGATE each element to their single-route validator, so claim (7)
//       already owns the five element keys, and this claim's job is to check
//       that they still delegate and that the one envelope key they hang the
//       list from agrees. A key renamed here is a picker that renders its
//       empty state with a phone that reports every push as sent.
//
//   (8) No destructive control in `ContentView.swift` destroys a run on one
//       tap. Both "Discard" buttons end a run that exists nowhere else — the
//       crash-recovery checkpoint, and a finished run WCSession has not been
//       handed — and neither the compiler nor any Swift test can see that one
//       of them lost its confirmation, because a `Button` that calls its
//       closure directly is the same program as one that arms a dialog first.
//       Each destructive `Button` must therefore either ARM a confirmation
//       (`<flag> = true`, bound to some `confirmationDialog(isPresented:)`) or
//       BE the confirming action inside one. Stop is not among them and never
//       was — it ends a run into a screen that still holds it — which is what
//       claim (16) is for.
//
//   (9) The DEBUG direct-to-Supabase path sends every field the WCSession
//       envelope sends. Two transports, one run, two hand-written field lists
//       — the § 1254 shape — and the DEBUG one is the path a watch-sim-alone
//       developer watches a row land on, so a field missing there sends them
//       to debug the wrong tier. It stayed missing because `RunPayload.metadata`
//       was typed `[String: String]`, which made the two numeric keys
//       unsendable rather than merely unsent; nothing failed, the row just
//       arrived short.
//
//  (10) The watch target's Info.plist is the only place its Info.plist keys
//       live. `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = NO` means Xcode uses the committed
//       file AS IS rather than merging the `INFOPLIST_KEY_*` build settings
//       into it, so every such setting on that target is INERT while reading
//       exactly like a declaration — which is how this app shipped with
//       `INFOPLIST_KEY_CFBundleDisplayName = "Threkir"` set on both
//       configurations and no `CFBundleDisplayName` in the plist at all,
//       leaving the watch app named by its target (`WatchApp`) on the wrist.
//       The same claim carries Apple's documented mutual exclusivity:
//       `WKWatchOnly` says the app has no iOS companion and cannot coexist
//       with `WKCompanionAppBundleIdentifier`, so a session resolving the
//       companion question must remove one while adding the other. And the
//       declaration is held against the only thing Linux can check it
//       against — whether the PHONE project bundles the watch app at all.
//       `WKWatchOnly` is a true description of the Xcode project and a false
//       one of an app whose whole sync path is `WCSession`; § 1256 measured
//       that flipping the key alone would move the lie rather than fix it,
//       because `Runner.xcodeproj` embeds nothing. So the plist follows the
//       build: the moment the embed lands, the guard says so, and a
//       companion named while nothing embeds fails the same way
//       (decisions § 1349). And the one PRECONDITION of that integration
//       Linux can decide is held too: watchOS pairs a watch app to its
//       companion by bundle id and requires the watch's to be the phone's
//       plus a suffix, so a rename on either side breaks the pairing the
//       five Mac steps exist to make — months before anyone runs them, and
//       surfacing on the day as "the watch app does not install" rather
//       than as anything naming a bundle id (decisions § 1597).
//
//  (12) The heart-rate coverage figures agree with Wear OS's. `avg_bpm` is
//       SUPPRESSED below a coverage threshold and coverage itself is advanced
//       against a sample-freshness window, and both watch clients write the
//       same `runs.avg_bpm` / `runs.metadata.hr_coverage` on the same
//       account. Two thresholds is one column with two meanings — the same
//       run recorded on either wrist keeps its average on one and loses it on
//       the other — and the two files have said so in each other's doc
//       comments since § 1083 with nothing able to see a divergence. They are
//       in NEITHER parity registry and cannot be: those pair web with mobile,
//       and the watch clients are additive surfaces under § 24. So the rail
//       is here, the way `check_shared_constants.mjs` carries the rails that
//       are not two clients of one registry (decisions § 1348).
//
//  (13) Every Swift file in the tree is a member of some target. A file
//       Xcode never compiles is not a build error and not a red test — it is
//       simply absent, and a TEST file that is absent takes its coverage with
//       it while still reading as coverage in the repo. That has already
//       happened once here: `Complications/ActiveRunComplication.swift` was in
//       no target for as long as it existed, which is why the now-retired
//       claim (4) existed at all — the Swift suite linked a second copy of the
//       formatters and passing proved nothing about the one the widget ran.
//       The same slip on
//       `HealthKitFailureTests.swift` would leave the `test-watch-ios` job
//       green having never run the accumulator that decides whether a shipped
//       run keeps its `avg_bpm` (decisions § 1350).
//
//  (15) The two Xcode projects that build this app describe the SAME app.
//       § 1256's build integration made `Runner.xcodeproj` a second project
//       compiling `apps/watch_ios/WatchApp` (decisions § 1679). The sources
//       are referenced there, never copied — but the target MEMBERSHIP, the
//       resource list and the settings that decide what the bundle is are
//       transcribed a second time, and the two transcriptions drift in
//       silence in both directions: a Swift file added to
//       `WatchApp.xcodeproj` alone is exercised by `test-watch-ios` and
//       absent from every shipped `.ipa`, and one added to `Runner.xcodeproj`
//       alone ships to a wrist having been compiled by nothing that runs a
//       test. Neither is a build error in either project. The membership
//       compare covers the `WatchAppComplication` extension as well as the
//       app: since the formatter duplication collapsed, files shared between
//       the app and the extension are the normal case rather than the
//       exception, and each one is a third membership list to keep. The
//       settings half stays on the app target, whose bundle identity is what
//       decides whether the two builds are the same app. The same claim
//       holds the EMBED, because deleting one copy phase turns the whole
//       integration back off while both projects still build and both suites
//       still pass — and claim (10) would then read the companion key as the
//       defect, which is the wrong end of it.
//
//  (14) No credential ships in the binary, Release still means Release, and
//       a session the wrist mints for itself lives in the Keychain.
//       `SupabaseService.swift` holds a caller handing GoTrue
//       `runner@test.com` / `testtest`, which is fine for exactly one reason:
//       that file is `#if DEBUG`-fenced and this project defines DEBUG on the
//       Debug configuration alone. Nothing held either half. Deleting the one
//       `#if DEBUG` line, or adding DEBUG to the Release configuration, each
//       ship a hardcoded credential — and the compiler is happy, the Swift
//       suite is green, and `env-isolation`'s scan of this same file looks for
//       LIVE key shapes, which a seed password is not. The sites are DERIVED
//       from the shape of a credential, so one appearing tomorrow in a
//       different file is covered without a list to extend (decisions § 1596).
//
//       The GRANT is a separate question and reads the opposite way now that
//       the watch has a sign-in of its own. `WatchAuth.swift` ships GoTrue's
//       password grant into Release deliberately — it is how a watch away
//       from its phone authenticates at all, which Wear OS's `SignInScreen`
//       has done since it shipped. What the fence used to be standing in for
//       is the thing now held directly: the session it mints is a bearer
//       credential, so it must go to the Keychain and never to
//       `UserDefaults`, which on watchOS is a plist in the app container that
//       travels in the watch's backup. A grant that ships with no Keychain
//       store in the tree, or a token written to `UserDefaults` anywhere,
//       fails here.
//
//  (15) Every stop control is gated on a HELD press. Stopping destroys
//       nothing — `PostRunView` still holds the finished run, its on-disk
//       track and a Sync Run button — so by
//       `docs/architecture/conventions.md` § Destructive actions it earns no
//       confirmation dialog, and claim (8) rightly does not ask for one. What
//       it does end is the RECORDING, on a wrist, where a sleeve brushing the
//       screen is the likeliest way for that to happen; Wear OS has required
//       an 800 ms press since it shipped. Nothing about a `Button` whose
//       closure calls `stop()` distinguishes it from one wired to a hold, so
//       the gate is checked here rather than assumed: no `Button` action may
//       call `workoutManager.stop()`, there must be one `HoldToStopButton`
//       per stop call site, and the press duration must still be what fires
//       it (decisions § 1680).
//
//  (19) The Swift suite is run in more than one language. Every assertion
//       about a formatted string reaches `Locale.current` somewhere — a
//       decimal separator, a `MeasurementFormatter` unit word, a String
//       Catalog lookup — and `test-watch-ios` pins its destination to one
//       simulator, so ONE language is the only one anything is ever measured
//       in. Four tests asserted English output and were green everywhere
//       anyone had run them while failing outright on a simulator left in
//       Japanese (`1.00 マイル`, `ランニング`). That is not a suite that is
//       locale-independent; it is a suite nobody has run twice. So the job
//       runs the same tests again under `-testLanguage`, and this claim is
//       what keeps the second pass there and in a DIFFERENT language from the
//       first — deleting it, or setting both to `en`, restores the blind spot
//       without failing anything else.
//  (20) The SETTINGS envelope going to the wrist — the runner's distance
//       unit and their audio-cue switch — read from all three of its ends.
//       Three hand-written key lists in three languages, the same shape as
//       claim (7): `apple_watch_prefs_bridge.dart` names them as
//       method-channel arguments, `WatchIngestBridge.prefsContext` lifts
//       those out and repacks them for `updateApplicationContext`, and
//       `PhonePreferences` reads them back on the watch. Unlike the route
//       chain a rename here does not drop the push — the watch applies each
//       key INDEPENDENTLY, so it drops one preference out of it with nothing
//       failing anywhere — and `audio_cues` is the only switch that can
//       silence a wrist with no settings screen of its own. The envelope
//       also rides a RETAINED application context, so a key the watch cannot
//       read is unreadable on every contact rather than once.
//
// WHAT THIS GUARD DOES NOT PROVE. It parses text. It does not compile Swift,
// does not run it, and cannot see anything a type-checker would: claim (1)
// matches a catalog key on the SHAPE of its interpolation, not on the type of
// what is interpolated, so swapping `\(anInt)` for `\(aString)` under a `%lld`
// key reads as unchanged here. Nothing in this file is evidence that the app
// builds. See docs/custom_watch/quality_standards.md for the rungs.

	// a source-grep inside `apps/mobile_android/test/architecture_guards_test
	// .dart`, transcribing six hint sentences it did not own. Renaming Stop's
	// hint for hold-to-stop rotted the transcription and failed `Test Flutter
	// packages` on 1 of 7,435 tests, taking `CI gate` with it, on a PR whose
	// author had run every watch guard and the whole watchOS suite green
	// (issue #965, decisions § 1687). It also failed OPEN: it began
	// `if (!file.existsSync()) return;`, so any change to the relative path
	// between the two apps would have made it pass silently forever.
	//
	// The literals themselves are not unchecked — claims (1) and (2) hold
	// every hint string against the String Catalog. What neither of those can
	// see is a control with no hint at all, which is this.
