/**
 * The versioned AI-processing consent record, end to end across the two
 * surfaces that write it and the two that refuse without it.
 *
 * Every other AI spec in the tree mocks the endpoint
 * (`routes/describe.spec.ts` fulfils `/api/coach/route-describe` itself) or
 * runs as a seeded user whom `seed.sql` already stamps at the current
 * version — so the gate has never been exercised against a real refusal.
 * That is the whole point of this file: a saga user starts with NO record,
 * so every request below reaches the real `gateAiDisclosure` and the real
 * `get_my_profile()` RPC.
 *
 * What it pins, in the order a person hits it:
 *
 *   1. `/coach` render-gates the chat behind the first-use disclosure —
 *      the composer is not merely disabled, it is not in the DOM, so no
 *      fetch can fan out to Anthropic before the click.
 *   2. Accepting records the CURRENT version server-side, not the minimum
 *      the Coach needs — the ladder is monotone and the widened
 *      disclosure is what was rendered.
 *   3. Withdrawing on `/settings/account` clears the whole record
 *      (Art 7(3)) and the `/coach` gate RE-ENGAGES. A consent gate that
 *      only closes on the way in is not a gate.
 *   4. The route AI refuses with its own copy after a withdrawal —
 *      pointing at Settings, not at "try again". A consent gap is not
 *      something a runner can retry away, and the L1 templated baseline
 *      still renders beside the refusal.
 *
 * Point 4 deliberately does NOT mock the endpoint: it drives the real
 * handler, whose disclosure gate sits ahead of the tier check and does not
 * honour the dev paywall bypass. No Anthropic key is needed to reach it.
