// Every surface that turns the runner's age into a health inference reads the
// date through `healthUseDob` (decisions § 722). The rule is mechanical and
// the drift is silent — a new `.date_of_birth` read compiles, renders, and
// looks right, and nothing about it says it just spent the ungated child-safety
// record on an Art 9 purpose. So it is pinned here rather than remembered.
//
// This list is health-USE surfaces only. `/settings/body` and
// `/settings/account` read the column directly on purpose: they edit the age
// record itself, and gating the editor is what produced § 718's deadlock (a
// runner whose consent lapsed could neither save nor clear their own date).
