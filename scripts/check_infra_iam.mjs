// Guardrail: the IAM rails under infra/ say what the pipeline needs and
// nothing wider, and the two halves of the OIDC trust contract move together.
//
// infra/github-oidc/ mints the only two AWS identities anything outside this
// account can assume. Their trust policies are the highest-value lines in the
// Terraform tree: `token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub` is what stops a
// job in another repository — or a pull_request build in this one, or a fork —
// from requesting the production deploy role. Nothing read those lines. The
// file's own header records that the halves have already come apart once: the
// web@1.0.3 release failed AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity when the deploy jobs
// started declaring GitHub environments while the trust policies still matched
// the old `refs/tags/web@*` ref shape. That header ends "the two halves must
// move together", which is a rule stated in prose and enforced by nothing —
// the § 439 shape.
//
// What is checked, and why each one is worth a job:
//
//   1. Trust shape. `StringEquals` on both `:aud` and `:sub`; a `:sub` with no
//      wildcard in it, anchored to `var.github_repo`, naming a GitHub
//      ENVIRONMENT rather than a ref. `StringLike` with a trailing `*` is the
//      canonical way this goes wrong, and it is one character from correct.
//   2. Environment lockstep. The set of environments the trust policies accept
//      equals the set release-web.yml can declare, and the role a tag-triggered
//      run assumes is the role whose resources are the production ones. This is
//      the half that broke.
//   3. No wildcard grant. No `Action` ending in `:*`, and `Resource = "*"` only
//      for actions AWS models no resource for — declared here with a reason,
//      and an exemption nothing uses fails as loudly as a missing one.
//   4. Blast-radius separation. Every resource ARN in a role's policy carries
//      that role's own environment token. A copy-pasted `prod` in the preview
//      role would hand every push-to-main preview deploy write access to the
//      production bucket, and the policy would still read as two tidy blocks.
//   5. Lambda coverage. The eight Lambda ARNs in each deploy policy are a
//      fourth hand-maintained transcription of the module's function list, next
//      to the three check_lambda_alias_sync.mjs already compares. A ninth
//      function reaches Terraform, the sync script and the release workflow and
//      then fails at `aws lambda update-function-code` with AccessDenied,
//      mid-release, against production.
//   6. Origin reachability. Every Lambda Function URL is AWS_IAM-authed and
//      carries BOTH CloudFront grants — `lambda:InvokeFunctionUrl` AND plain
//      `lambda:InvokeFunction`. Issue #590 measured what one grant alone does:
//      the URL 403s before invocation and the distribution's SPA error fallback
//      rewrites that 403 into the shell at 200, so the surface reads healthy
//      while the function never runs.
//
//   7. Alias lockstep. Each Function URL is created ON the function's `live`
//      alias, and a Lambda resource policy is attached per qualifier — so a
//      grant written without the alias qualifier covers the unqualified ARN and
//      not the one CloudFront invokes. That is #590's failure exactly, one
//      field over, and it fails the same invisible way. The parser also
//      declares how many blocks it SKIPPED: a Function URL written so the
//      function-name regex misses it is one whose auth type nothing reads, and
//      a smaller loop looks identical to a smaller stack.
//
//   8. Secret scope. No Lambda environment merges the decrypted sops map whole.
//      A key added to the file for one function otherwise reaches every
//      function whose env takes the bag, which is the same over-grant as a
//      wildcard Action and is invisible in exactly the same way — the
//      Terraform reads as one tidy `merge(...)` line either way.
//
//   9. Decrypt-grant justification. The env's secrets CMK is the one key in the
//      account whose loss is unrecoverable, and its decrypt statement is where
//      a principal quietly accumulates. Both env roots now leave
//      `kms_decrypt_principal_arn` at "" — the GitHub deploy role is NOT a
//      decrypt principal — and that is only correct while two premises hold,
//      neither of which is stated anywhere a change would trip over:
//      no CREDENTIALED workflow job runs `terraform` (so nothing in CI ever
//      reaches `data.sops_file`), and no `aws_lambda_function` sets
//      `kms_key_arn` (so `lambda:UpdateFunctionCode` from the
//      deploy role never transits this key). The check runs BOTH ways: a
//      non-empty wire while both premises hold is standing privilege, and an
//      empty wire once either premise breaks is a release that fails with
//      AccessDenied against production, mid-deploy. decisions § 1021.
//
//      The workflow scan reads `.github/workflows/*.yml` and nothing else,
//      because a composite action's `runs.steps` is a different shape and
//      needs a second parser. Rather than leave that as a silent blind spot,
//      the claim asserts what makes it safe: no composite action under
//      .github/actions/ assumes an AWS role. The day one does, this fails and
//      says to widen the scan — which is the only outcome that cannot be a
//      false negative about a credentialed terraform run nobody read.
//
//  10. Lambda verb scope, PER ENVIRONMENT. The `lambda:` actions on each deploy
//      role equal the set of `aws lambda` operations the workflows invoke
//      AGAINST THAT ROLE'S OWN ENVIRONMENT, derived from their `run:` bodies.
//      `GetFunction`, `GetAlias` and `PublishVersion` were granted and
//      exercised by nothing (§ 1085) — the same shape as the KMS grant § 1021
//      removed, and the same way it accumulated: a verb is added when someone
//      is unsure, and nothing ever asks again. The derivation's premise is that
//      a workflow is the only thing holding these roles' credentials, which
//      claim 9's scan already establishes; the operator's own SSO profile is
//      what runs `bin/lambda-alias-sync.sh`.
//
//      Comparing both roles against the UNION of every verb any workflow runs
//      is right only while every credentialed job deploys every environment,
//      which release-web.yml does today. A workflow deploying one environment
//      only would make the union demand a verb the other never issues, and the
//      fix would then read as widening a role rather than narrowing a
//      derivation. So a verb is attributed to the environments its job can
//      assume a role for — the `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN_<ENV>` Secrets it names —
//      narrowed by the step's own `if:` when that reads an output of the job's
//      env branch. § 1110.
//
// Offline by design: no AWS credentials, no `terraform init`. Nothing here is
// transcribed — every name, every environment, every function suffix and every
// workflow job is read out of one of the sources, which are the github-oidc
// stack and its variables, the web-stack module, the two env roots, and every
// workflow under .github/workflows/.
//
// Run: `node scripts/check_infra_iam.mjs`
// CI:  the `infra-guards` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml, which is in the
//      `CI gate` aggregator's `needs:` list — a guard nothing runs enforces
//      nothing.
// Unit tests: `node --test scripts/check_infra_iam.test.mjs`
