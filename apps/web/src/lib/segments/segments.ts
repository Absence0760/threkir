/**
 * Segment-effort extraction (decisions §37).
 *
 * v1 segments are slices of a *saved route* — `(start_distance_m,
 * end_distance_m)`. To produce an effort time for a run that follows
 * the route, we walk the run's track once, accumulate cumulative
 * distance via haversine, and record the timestamps at the moments
 * cumulative distance crosses `start_distance_m` and `end_distance_m`.
 *
 * Every position read off the run track is its LINE position
 * (`runs/track_line.ts`): the smoother's fix when the stored waypoint carries
 * both halves of it, else the raw one. Raw zig-zag inflates the hop-summed
 * distance, which moves the crossings and trips the end-to-end guard on a run
 * that did follow the segment. Timestamps are untouched — the crossings still
 * interpolate between the same fixes' `ts`.
 *
 * Pure module — no Supabase, no DOM. Stress-tested in segments.test.ts.
