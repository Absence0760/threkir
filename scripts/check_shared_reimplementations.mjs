// Guardrail: no web module privately reimplements a helper the shared `lib/`
// tree already exports.
//
// Why it exists (decisions § 1397). The tree has hit this four times and
// every guard it had stayed green through all four. `check_parity_pair_registry.mjs`
// compares the two REGISTRIES and not the two behaviours (§ 852), so a private
// copy is simply not a pair anyone declared; `check_shared_constants.mjs` only
// compares rails it has been told about. The four:
//
//   § 852   a hand-written Dart fold table beside the generated one
//   § 1340  `dm_recipients.ts` held a fourth private `fold`, missing the one
//           step — the final-sigma collapse — the canonical exists to add
//   § 1334-integration  the exercise-catalogue picker held a byte-identical
//           private copy of `compareFoldedNames`
//   § 1398  `planSlug` derived a slug with `toLowerCase()` where `clubSlug`
//           folds, which is § 1251's `İzmir` -> `i-zmir` reversal again
//
// ANCHORING. A guard keyed on a NAME fails the moment someone renames; one
// keyed on the existence of a DECLARATION passes a copy that declares nothing;
// one keyed on a spelling (`fail on the literal "normalize('NFD')"`) fails
// correct code and passes a copy written differently. So both anchors here are
// keyed on what cannot be removed without changing behaviour:
//
//   A. the function's normalised BODY — every token it runs, with only the
//      things that are free to change stripped: comments, whitespace, the
//      function's own name, and the SPELLING of its parameters and locals
//      (alpha-renamed to $0..$n by declaration order). What survives is the
//      operations it calls, the properties it reads, the literals it passes
//      and its control-flow shape. Two functions with the same fingerprint run
//      the same code.
//
//   B. the DISTINCTIVE OPERATIONS it reaches for — method calls carrying a
//      string or regex literal argument, e.g. `normalize('NFD')` or
//      `replace(/\p{Diacritic}/gu,'')`. A rewritten copy, or one that omits a
//      step, still has to reach for the same primitives; § 1340's copy shared
//      three with the canonical.
//
// Both anchors survive renaming the function, its parameters, its locals, and
// any reformatting or comment edit. Neither survives a copy that reaches for
// genuinely different primitives — which is the honest floor: a
// reimplementation that shares no operation and no body shape with the
// original is not detectable by reading either one.
//
// FALSE POSITIVES. Anchor A's are near-zero at the size floor: free
// identifiers stay verbatim, so two functions collide only when they call the
// same things in the same order. Anchor B's are real and measured — two
// functions can share a vocabulary without one being a copy of the other
// (`platformIcon` and `detectPlatform` both speak of `'android'` / `'mac'` /
// `'windows'` / `'linux'` because that is the vocabulary, not because either
// wrote the other). They go in REGISTERED, which states what each actually is.
//
// FALSE NEGATIVES, stated rather than discovered later:
//   - Only a group with an EXPORTED `apps/web/src/lib/**` member is reported.
//     Duplication with nothing shared to import is a different finding, and
//     the house rule ("three similar lines is better than a premature helper")
//     tolerates it. The nine copies of `escapeJsonLd` were the standing
//     example until § 1475 made them one exported `serialiseJsonLd`, which is
//     what brings a tenth copy into reach: measured, a private copy is caught
//     both as a named function and as an inline replace chain. The residue
//     this exemption still cannot see is a builder that omits the escape
//     ENTIRELY, which is why `apps/web/src/lib/util/json_ld_escaping.test.ts`
//     censuses the builders and calls each one.
//   - Anchor A finds identical copies, not the whole equivalence class: the
//     tree held seventeen great-circle distances (not the eleven this comment
//     once claimed) and only the two structurally identical ones were one
//     group. `routes/great_circle_sources.test.ts` reads the CLASS instead,
//     by the arc-of-a-square-root every haversine has to compute (§ 1470).
//   - Anonymous callbacks are not extracted; a copy pasted into an inline
//     arrow is missed. Named function declarations and named `const` arrows
//     are, which is every shape a copied helper has taken here.
//   - Cross-LANGUAGE reimplementation (§ 852's Dart table against the web
//     fold) is out of reach of a reader of one language, and stays with
//     `check_parity_pair_registry.mjs` and the shared-constant rails.
//
// Run: `node scripts/check_shared_reimplementations.mjs`
// CI:  the `parity-types` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml, which is in the
//      `CI gate` aggregator's `needs:` list.
// Unit tests: `node --test scripts/check_shared_reimplementations.test.mjs`
