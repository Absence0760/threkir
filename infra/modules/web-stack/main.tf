# ──────────────────────────── KMS key for sops ────────────────────────────

# Explicit key policy, enumerating four statements rather than taking the
# AWS default.
#
# READ THE POSTURE HONESTLY: an Identity Center principal with
# `AdministratorAccess` CAN decrypt this env's sops secrets. The
# `AllowOperatorSopsUseViaIamPolicies` statement below delegates
# Encrypt/Decrypt/GenerateDataKey to the account root, which means
# "whatever this account's own IAM policies allow" — and an admin's do.
# That is deliberate and load-bearing, not an oversight: `sops <file>`,
# `sops --set` (bin/secret-set.sh) and `sops updatekeys`
# (bin/key-rotate.sh) all decrypt before they re-encrypt, so an operator
# with no Decrypt has no way to rotate a secret. This comment used to
# claim the opposite — that root could manage the key "but not call
# Decrypt directly" — which was true only for the two weeks before that
# statement was added, and is the sentence a reader would otherwise
# carry into a threat model. The residual risk (any account admin can
# read prod secrets) is tracked in docs/product/followups.md; narrowing
# it means a dedicated operator principal, not deleting the statement.
#
# What the enumeration DOES buy over the AWS default: the default grants
# root every KMS action including `kms:*` on future ones, while this
# lists them, so a new privileged action is a deliberate edit; and
# CloudWatch Logs + the delegated roles are each scoped to what they
# need rather than inheriting the whole surface.
#
# The four statements:
#   - Account root may ADMINISTER the key (create / describe / enable /
#     tag / schedule deletion). No data-plane action here.
#   - The CloudWatch Logs service principal may use the key for the
#     Lambda log groups, scoped by encryption context to this env's
#     `/aws/lambda/<prefix>-*` groups.
#   - Account root may Encrypt/Decrypt/GenerateDataKey via IAM policies,
#     for the local operator sops flows described above.
#   - Decrypt + DescribeKey for the Lambda execution role. NEITHER
#     principal in that statement has ever been shown to exercise it,
#     and the sentence this comment used to carry — that the execution
#     role "decrypts the sops env at cold-start" — is not what happens:
#     data.sops_file decrypts at APPLY time and `local.lambda_env` puts
#     the result into `environment { variables }` as plaintext, so the
#     handler reads process.env and calls no KMS API (measured: no
#     `kms` reference anywhere under apps/web/lambda/). The env vars are
#     encrypted at rest by the AWS-managed `aws/lambda` key, not by this
#     CMK — no aws_lambda_function here sets `kms_key_arn`. The deploy
#     role was removed from the statement in decisions § 1021; the
#     execution role's grant is unexercised for the same reason and is
#     filed in followups.md rather than removed, because emptying the
#     statement is a structural change and one live-configuration read
#     settles it. scripts/check_infra_iam.mjs holds both premises.

#
# Per-request SSR handler for /share/badge/<id> (HTML + OG tags) +
# /og/badge/<id>.png (1200x630 card PNG). Renders the public,
# milestone-safe badge columns — a numeric milestone + a date, no track,
# no location — so a badge earned after the last web build still unfurls
# with the right per-badge head AND a rendered image, regardless of
# build cadence. The PNG path falls back to a generic branded card
# (HTTP 200) for missing / private badges so an unfurl never breaks.
# Symmetric mirror of the share-run / share-route / share-recap Lambdas
# above. See apps/web/lambda/share-badge/README.md for the bundle shape
# + lifecycle.
#
# Reuses the existing `aws_iam_role.lambda` execution role + CloudWatch
# log group naming so the operator surface stays uniform across the
# share Lambdas — single role, single dashboard, single alarm fan-out.

  # via `payloadSha256Hex` at each fetch site, #590), but CloudFront reads it
  # off the viewer request itself and folds it into the signature. Forwarding
  # is neither needed nor permitted.
  #
  # The trap this comment exists for: a POST that omits the header gets a 403
  # from the Function URL, which the distribution's `403 -> /200.html` mapping
  # turns into `200 text/html`. That looks exactly like a broken origin, and a

  # SPA fallback — adapter-static's fallback is build/200.html, and the

  # These apply to EVERY origin on the distribution, not just S3.
  # CloudFront models custom error responses per DISTRIBUTION; there is no

  # 200 text/html body where a refusal was sent. 404 is NOT mapped: § 1022
  # added one and § 1084 removed it again, so the sentence that used to sit
  # here describing "a 404 to the shell at 404" outlived its own mapping and
  # disagreed with the block immediately below. The comment
  # here used to claim the opposite — that a Lambda's own 404 surfaced as a real
  # 404 because its behaviour ran first — and the `cloudfront_invoke_function`
  # block above records the measurement that disproves it: with only one of the
  # two OAC grants the Function URL 403s before invocation, this fallback
  # rewrites that 403 into the shell at 200, and the surface reads healthy while
  # the Lambda never runs (issue #590, proven 2026-07-21). Two comments in one
  # file cannot both be true; this is the one that was wrong.
  #
  # The consequence is a monitoring contract, not a config one: a Lambda-origin
  # failure is invisible to a viewer AND to a synthetic check, so every Lambda
  # in this module carries an error-rate alarm and a p95 alarm in alarms.tf, and
  # the two engine-backed ones additionally carry an `engine_unreachable` log
  # filter for the clean-502 path the Errors metric never sees. That coverage is
  # the only signal these failures have; `scripts/check_infra_coverage.mjs`
  # fails the PR when a function is added without it.
  #
  # 403 is the one status mapped to the shell, and it is mapped because the
  # S3 bucket policy grants
  # s3:GetObject only (no s3:ListBucket), so S3 answers a missing key
  # with 403 AccessDenied, not 404 — a deep-link / hard-refresh / crawl
  # of a dynamic client route (/dashboard, /runs/<id>, /u/<id>, …) hits
  # the 403 path. Without the 403 mapping those routes surface
  # AccessDenied instead of the SPA. This is the standard CloudFront+S3
  # SPA idiom; the distribution serves no genuinely access-protected S3
  # keys (all objects are the public static build), so nothing legitimate
  # is masked by turning 403 into the shell.
  #
  # The shell is /200.html and NOT /index.html: since decisions § 1268 the
  # landing page is prerendered onto index.html, and that document is not a
  # shell — its asset URLs are relative (`./_app/…`, resolved against the
  # request path, so nothing loads under /runs/<id>) and its hydration payload
  # names route "/". Pointing this back at /index.html serves the landing page,
  # broken, for every client route. `apps/web/src/lib/seo/spa_shell_filename.test.ts`
  # reads this block, apps/web/svelte.config.js's adapter fallback and the five
  # share Lambdas' build scripts, and fails when they disagree.
  #
  # Changing this value has a deploy order: /200.html must exist in the bucket
  # BEFORE the apply, or every deep link resolves to a missing error page. See
  # docs/features/seo.md § Deploying a change to the shell filename, and
  # docs/ops/deployment.md § One-off: the SPA-shell cutover for the operator
  # sequence with its rollback.
  custom_error_response {
    error_code         = 403
    response_code      = 200
    response_page_path = "/200.html"
  }

  # There is deliberately NO `custom_error_response` for 404, and
  # `scripts/check_infra_error_responses.mjs` fails the PR if one comes back.
  #
  # § 1022 added one because the five share Lambdas' own 404 bodies were a
  # single unstyled English sentence, so the shell had to be substituted for
  # them; the cost was that the substitution also discarded the `noindex` those
  # bodies carried, which is the tag the whole crawler fix was about. § 1036
  # made all five return the SPA shell AT 404 themselves — through the same
  # `injectEntityHead` that strips a stale `og:*`/canonical/JSON-LD — so the
  # premise is gone and the mapping now only replaces an honest body with an
  # identical one, minus the tag. Dropping it is what puts the `noindex` on the
  # wire. It also stops `/api/coach*` answering a JSON 404 as an HTML shell.
  #
  # S3 never reaches this path anyway: the bucket policy grants s3:GetObject
  # with no s3:ListBucket, so a missing key is 403 AccessDenied and lands on
  # the block above. decisions § 1084.
  #
  # 403 stays at 200 and MUST: that is the deep-link path (every dynamic
  # client route is a missing S3 key), and answering it 403 would break the
  # whole SPA. decisions § 1022.
