// Guardrail: every iOS capability the phone app's code exercises is declared
// in `Info.plist` / `Runner.entitlements`, and the requirement is DERIVED from
// the code that needs it rather than transcribed from a list.
//
// Why this exists: decisions.md § 742. Two capabilities the shipped Dart
// depends on were undeclared, and both failed silently rather than loudly.
// `audio_cues.dart` puts the TTS session in AVAudioSession's `playback`
// category — the navigation-cue configuration — while `UIBackgroundModes`
// declared only `location` and `processing`, and iOS gates background audio
// OUTPUT on the `audio` mode specifically. A runner who pockets the phone
// mid-run, the case the cues exist for, hears nothing; the recording is
// unaffected, so nothing surfaces. Separately, `firebase_messaging` is a live
// dependency and the entitlements carried no `aps-environment`, so a signed
// build could not register for APNs at all.
//
// Neither was catchable by anything that runs. A `group('iOS Info.plist')`
// existed in `architecture_guards_test.dart` and read these very files, but
// every assertion sat behind `if (!file.existsSync()) return;` and the only
// package where the file exists — `mobile_ios` — is not in the `test-packages`
// job's `melos exec --scope=` list. Twelve tests, zero executions, for as long
// as they had existed: the § 741 shape, a guard whose verdict was decided by
// its environment rather than by the code. Those tests are gone; this script
// is what replaced them, and it runs on every PR against the one tree where
// the files exist.
//
// The derivation is the point (§ 739 / § 740). A guard that restates
// `['location', 'processing', 'audio']` is a second copy of the plist and
// drifts from the code the same way the first one did. Every rule below names
// a PATTERN IN THE SOURCE and the declaration that pattern obliges, so
// deleting the TTS playback category deletes the `audio` requirement with it,
// and adding a plugin that needs a purpose string fails the build until the
// string is written.
//
// Run: `node scripts/check_ios_native_declarations.mjs`
// CI:  the `ios-native-declarations` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml, which is
//      in the `CI gate` aggregator's `needs:` list.
// Unit tests: `node --test scripts/check_ios_native_declarations.test.mjs`
