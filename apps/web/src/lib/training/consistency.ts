/**
 * Training-consistency derivation for the dashboard "Consistency" card.
 *
 * Consistency — how regularly you train, week to week — is a distinct signal
 * from the dashboard's other analytics: VDOT measures your fitness ceiling,
 * the training-load trio measures acute fatigue/form, the race predictor
 * projects times, the mileage chart shows raw volume, and the run streak
 * counts consecutive DAYS. This measures the fraction of recent calendar
 * WEEKS you trained at all, the trailing run of active weeks, and whether
 * your weekly volume is steady or spiky.
 *
 * Pure: no Supabase, no DOM, no rune state — so it unit-tests under
 * `tsx --test`. Web-only by design (no Dart twin); deliberately kept off the
 * enforced web↔mobile parity list.
