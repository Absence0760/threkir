// Source-scan guard for issue #666 V8: a stat tile is `StatTile` (ui_kit) and
// the row it sits in is `StatGrid`. Twelve private classes drew the same
// value-over-label pair before this, and the drift between them was the
// defect: six value type sizes, two label sizes, two muted colours, and three
// different answers to "what happens when the value is too wide" — one of
// which (an intrinsically-sized cell in a `Row(spaceAround)`) had no answer at
// all and simply overflowed.
//
// Three rules:
//
//  * The set of remaining stat-named `StatelessWidget`s is CLOSED. Each entry
//    below is a documented non-tile, and the reason is part of the entry: a
//    thirteenth hand-rolled tile fails this test rather than passing review.
//  * The migrated surfaces must still REFERENCE `StatTile`, so the adoption
//    cannot be quietly undone one screen at a time.
//  * `StatTile` / `StatGrid` / `SectionHeader` are ui_kit names and may not be
//    redeclared locally — a local shadow would satisfy every rule above while
//    reopening the drift.
//
// When this test fails: use `StatTile.small` / `.medium` / `.large` inside a
// `StatGrid`, or add an entry here WITH the reason it is not a tile.
