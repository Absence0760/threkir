// Package schema is the worker's single registry of the Supabase
// vocabulary the Go code talks to over PostgREST + Storage REST:
// table names, Storage bucket names, the `runs.metadata` jsonb keys,
// and the `user_settings.prefs` keys.
//
// Before this package every `/rest/v1/<table>` path, every
// `/storage/v1/object/<bucket>/` path, and every `metadata["<key>"]`
// access spelled its table / bucket / key as a bare string literal,
// scattered across supabase.go, livehub/, dataexport/, and premium/.
// A typo ("run_photo" for "run_photos") would compile and only fail at
// runtime against a 404; a renamed table meant grepping for a string.
// Routing them through these constants makes the set of tables the
// worker touches enumerable (the data-export coverage guard in
// supabase package depends on it) and a rename a one-line edit.
//
// These names mirror the Postgres schema in
// apps/backend/supabase/migrations and the registries in
// docs/backend/{metadata,settings}.md. Keep them in lockstep — a
// constant here that drifts from the DB is the same latent 404 the
// bare literals were.
package schema

// Table is a PostgREST table name — the `<table>` in `/rest/v1/<table>`.
