# onboard-operator.sh — grant a second human (or role) access to the
# project's sops-encrypted secrets, by adding kms:Decrypt + kms:Encrypt
# to the per-env KMS key policy.
#
# Threkir uses per-env KMS keys (one per `infra/envs/<env>`)
# rather than a single shared key, so onboarding is a per-env action.
#
# What this does:
#   1. Reads the current key policy via `aws kms get-key-policy`
#   2. Appends a statement granting Decrypt + Encrypt to <principal-arn>
#      (or skips if the principal is already in there)
#   3. Writes the updated policy back via `aws kms put-key-policy`
#
# What it does NOT do:
#   - Doesn't add the principal to the GitHub Actions deploy role
#   - Doesn't grant terraform-apply permissions (that's a separate IAM
#     decision — operators usually have AdministratorAccess via SSO)
#   - Doesn't `sops updatekeys` the encrypted file — IAM is the source
#     of truth, no per-recipient re-encryption is needed for KMS sops
#
# Caveat — IaC drift: this script mutates the KMS key policy via API,
# which means the next `terraform apply` on the env may revert the
# change unless the policy is recomputed by the module. Long-term, the
# right home for "additional principals" is a terraform variable on
# `infra/modules/web-stack`. Treat this script as a stopgap for
# urgent onboarding before that var lands.
#
# Usage:
#   bin/onboard-operator.sh <principal-arn> [env]
#
#   bin/onboard-operator.sh arn:aws:iam::123:user/jane preview
#   bin/onboard-operator.sh arn:aws:iam::123:role/Admin both
