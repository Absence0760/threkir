/**
 * Guard-rail: a response body is parsed inside a `try`, behind a `.catch`, or
 * with a registered reason why throwing is the contract.
 *
 * `res.json()` rejects on a 200 whose body is truncated or is not JSON — a
 * proxy error page, a captive portal, a connection cut mid-stream. § 1066
 * found `geocodeViaMapTiler` doing that inside a function documented to return
 * null, forty lines from a sibling that guarded it, and asked for the class to
 * be searched. It ran to two more (§ 1087): `geocodeViaNominatim`, the OTHER
 * branch of the same exported function, and `snapToRoad`, whose whole contract
 * was to hand back the unsnapped point on every failure. That second one went
 * with the dead `routing.ts` exports (§ 1119), which is why a reader arriving
 * from § 1087 finds no routing.ts row in the register below.
 *
 * The rule is not "every parse must be guarded": three of the sites here
 * document a THROWS contract, and their callers depend on it to tell a failed
 * source from an empty one. The contract lives in a doc comment, not in the
 * return type — `lookupBarcode` returns `Promise<T | null>` and throws on a
 * parse failure on purpose — so a deliberate site is registered by hand with
 * its reason and its count. A count that drifts fails, in both directions: a
 * new unguarded parse in a registered file, and a registered file that no
 * longer has one.
 *
 * Invocation:
 *   npx tsx --test src/lib/response_body_parse_guard.test.ts
