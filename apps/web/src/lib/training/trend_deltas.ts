/**
 * Week-over-week and month-over-month trend deltas for the dashboard summary
 * stats (backlog #11, advanced analytics polish).
 *
 * Reports how the runner's distance / time / run-count is trending by comparing
 * the CURRENT period-to-date against the SAME to-date window of the PRIOR
 * period — week-to-date vs prior-week-to-date, month-to-date vs
 * prior-month-to-date. Comparing equal-length elapsed windows is what keeps a
 * mid-week glance honest: a partial current week is measured against the same
 * partial slice of last week, not against last week's full total (which would
 * always read "down" until the week is over).
 *
 * All boundaries are LOCAL-time and honour the `week_start_day` preference, so
 * the week delta agrees with the dashboard's "This Week" stat card and the
 * ThisWeekStrip ribbon that sit beside it.
 *
 * Pure: no Supabase, no DOM, no rune state — unit-tested under `tsx --test`.
 * Web-only by design (no Dart twin); deliberately kept off the enforced
 * web↔mobile parity list.
