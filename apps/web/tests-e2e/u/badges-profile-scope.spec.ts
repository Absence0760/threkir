/**
 * /u/[id]?tab=achievements — the lazily-hydrated badge cache is keyed on the
 * PROFILE it belongs to.
 *
 * `/u/[id]` is one component reused across profiles (the followers list links
 * are same-route client navs), and `loadBadges` early-returned on a bare
 * `badgesLoaded` flag that no navigation reset. So viewing your own
 * achievements and then opening someone else's rendered YOUR badges under
 * THEIR name — and `fetchUserBadges` returns every row for self, including
 * `is_public = false` ones, so private achievements were shown as a stranger's
 * public ones. The `$effect` also failed to track `userId`, because
 * `loadBadges`' early return consumed it before it became a dependency.
