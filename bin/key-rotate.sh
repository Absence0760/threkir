# key-rotate.sh — re-encrypt an env's secrets file under the current
# KMS key. The encrypted file lives in the PRIVATE estate repo
# (../infra-secrets/threkir/<env>.sops.yaml), NOT this public repo.
#
# Use case: you've changed the KMS key (via terraform — destroyed +
# recreated, or moved to a different key in the estate `.sops.yaml`),
# and the encrypted file still has the OLD key in its sops metadata.
# sops auto-decrypts against whatever key it was encrypted with, so
# the file keeps WORKING — but the next operator with access only to
# the new key can't decrypt it. This script reads the file with the
# old key, re-encrypts under the new key recorded in the estate
# `.sops.yaml`. Remember to commit the re-encrypted file in the
# private estate repo afterward.
#
# Note on AWS-native KMS rotation: enabling automatic key rotation
# (`aws kms enable-key-rotation`) does NOT require this script —
# rotation under the same key alias is transparent to sops. Use
# this script only when the *key itself* (not just the key material)
# changes.

# Usage:
#   bin/key-rotate.sh <env>
#   bin/key-rotate.sh preview
