// Mutation-check the handler-envelope integration suite against the SERVED
// Edge Function tree.
//
// decisions.md 788 mutation-checks the Deno suite by neutering every module the
// TEST PROCESS imports. `_shared/handler_envelope.test.ts` imports none of
// them: it drives a separately-booted `supabase functions serve` host over
// HTTP, so that operator scores its cases as neither killed nor survived. They
// were the only Edge Function assertions in the repo with no measurement
// behind them (decisions § 815).
//
// The operator here mutates the tree the HOST is serving, one gate at a time,
// and requires the case that claims to guard that gate to FAIL. `functions
// serve` re-reads a changed module on the next request (measured ~1.4 s), so
// this costs no second host boot and no second stack - which is what the
// followup entry had priced it at.
//
// One mutation per round, not a bundle, because the point is ATTRIBUTION: a
// blanket break proves only that each case notices a dead function, which is
// the weaker claim § 788 already makes about everything else. `spares` is how
// a round says what must NOT move, and it is what separates "this case
// measures the compare" from "this case measures that the gate exists at all".
// Two of the entries below found that difference: the bare-GET secret test was
// answered 403 by the verify-token gate whatever the secret gate did, and the
// verify-token gate itself killed nothing in the file.
//
// COVERAGE IS ENFORCED, on three edges, and it took all three to make the
// obligation true. `unmeasuredCases` requires every case the baseline RAN to
// appear in some mutation's `kills`; `phantomKills` requires every named case
// to have run. Those two alone left the claim this comment used to make - "a
// new case fails this guard until a mutation names it" - false for a case that
// does not run: `parseJunit` drops deno's `<skipped/>` entries, so a case whose
// `ignore:` gate is never false in CI is in neither set and is measured by
// nothing while reading as green. `declaredCases` + `unnamedDeclaredCases` are
// the third edge, static and host-free: every case the FILE declares must be
// killed by a mutation or carry an `UNMEASURED_CASES` reason it is not owed
// one. With `ran ⊆ kills`, `kills ⊆ ran` and `declared ⊆ kills`, the three sets
// are one. An unmeasured integration case is exactly what § 815 closed.
//
//   --report    print the per-mutation verdict table
//   --json      machine-readable result
//   default     guard: fail on a survivor, a moved spare, or an unmeasured case
//
// Needs: a running local Supabase stack + an env-loaded `supabase functions
// serve` host (the `edge-functions` CI job's boot step), SUPABASE_TEST_URL, and
// the same webhook secrets that host loaded. Without SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
// the four side-effect cases skip in the baseline and their mutations are
// skipped with them.
