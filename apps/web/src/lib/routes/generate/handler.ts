/**
 * Transport-agnostic core for the "Generate a route by distance" endpoint.
 *
 * Wrapped twice — once by the SvelteKit dev route
 * (`src/routes/api/routes/generate/+server.ts`) and once by the production AWS
 * Lambda (`apps/web/lambda/generate-route/src/index.ts`) — mirroring the coach
 * handler's two-wrapper shape (decisions §53). Validates the request, then runs
 * the generator chain and returns a finished polyline the client renders
 * directly (no further OSRM routing).
 *
 * Generator chain (docs/features/graph_cycle_loop_generation.md, v3):
 *   1. graph-cycle FIRST — the self-hosted graph_cycle sidecar searches the real
 *      foot graph for a clean loop near target, carrying the road-design
 *      preference. This is the durable generator; it traces the neighbourhood
 *      loop geometry can't find.
 *   2. round_trip fallback — GraphHopper's `round_trip` (multi-distance race),
 *      under a `custom_model` where GraphHopper can express the preference, when
 *      graph-cycle is loop-poor or unreachable.
 * The v2 polygon generator is retired: graph-cycle beat it at every spike start.
 * A preference no longer diverts the whole request onto the fallback: it rides
 * the chain, and the served loop reports back which preference (if any) was
 * actually applied, so the client can be honest about an ask it couldn't meet.
 *
 * Fail-closed: no engine URL → 501 (operator config); an engine that's down →
 * 502; an engine that answered but found no loop worth serving near this start
 * → 422; bad input → 400. The 502/422 split matters beyond politeness: the
 * Lambda logs the alarm-driving `engine_unreachable` line on every 502, so a
 * loop-poor neighbourhood answering 502 pages the on-call over geography and
 * makes a real GraphHopper outage indistinguishable from it.
 *
 * Server-side generation is a Pro perk (decisions §204): after validation the
 * handler requires a user JWT and a true `is_pro()`, mirroring the
 * route_describe handler. The 501 is checked BEFORE the tier gate so an
 * unconfigured deploy (rock-bottom / Lean, engines deferred) answers "not
 * available" rather than "upgrade" — the client must never see an upsell for a
 * perk the deploy can't deliver. Free and unauthenticated callers fall back to
 * the in-browser OSRM heuristic, which stays the free tier.
