# Club events — typed sessions with optional paid registration

> **Goal / north star.** The product's north star is a **personal multi-modal training app whose differentiator is cross-modal intelligence** — a Coach that reasons across one athlete's runs, lifts, and nutrition (see [multi_modal.md](multi_modal.md)). That is the wedge no incumbent owns. This plan serves that goal by making clubs a **retention and community layer in service of the individual athlete — not a second business.** Typed events let a club be about *fitness* rather than only running (a runner who also does a weekly pilates class stays in one app), and paid registration lets the instructors who anchor those communities sustain them. We are deliberately **not** pivoting into a standalone fitness marketplace (ClassPass / Mindbody territory); the marketplace mechanics exist only to keep athletes and the people who train them inside the one app where the cross-modal intelligence lives. Every gate below answers to that — if a slice doesn't deepen engagement with the core app, it doesn't ship.

A **club is a generic container.** A club hosts events of different *types* — a group run, a yoga class, a pilates class, a social meetup — and **any** event, of any type, can require **paid** registration where the money goes to the **instructor who hosts it**, not the club. This spec has two coupled halves:

- **Slice E — event-type generalization.** Today the event model is running-specific: every event editor shows route / distance / target pace / race-mode / results-leaderboard fields. A yoga instructor scheduling a class is forced through running concepts that make no sense. E makes events *typed*, with fields that **self-hide** to the chosen type — the same progressive-disclosure rule the multi-modal redesign uses ([multi_modal.md](multi_modal.md)).
- **Slice P — paid registration.** A marketplace layer (Stripe Connect) so a host can charge for any event type; the charge settles into the *host's* account, the platform takes a fee, and a completed payment is what grants the RSVP.

> **Status:** Slice E **shipped** (web create + web/mobile read) and Slice P1's rail **built on web** (gated — see below). The schema foundation (migration `20261227_001`: `events.category`/`discipline`/`host_user_id`/`gym_template` + the athletic-only data-layer guards + pgtap) and the pure `isAthleticCategory` predicate (web + mobile twin) have landed; the **mobile** category-gated read-only event-detail surface has also landed (`event_detail_screen.dart` on both twins — athletic affordances gated behind `isAthleticEventCategory(category)`, a `class` shows its free-text discipline via `EventDisciplineLabel`); the **web** type-first editor (`EventEditor.svelte` — category segmented picker as the first control, discipline free-text for a `class`, athletic fields self-hide + clear on category change, `createEvent` persists `category` + `discipline`) and the **web** category-gated event-detail surface (`/clubs/[slug]/events/[id]` — distance/pace/route, race panel + banner, and the whole results/leaderboard/Submit-my-time/certificate/claims section gate on `isAthleticCategory(event.category)`; a non-athletic event shows its discipline in the hero + an attendance-only note) have now landed. The earlier `EVENT_SELECT_COLS` gap is closed: it now selects `category` + `discipline`, and migration `20261228_001` grants cross-user SELECT on those two columns (the column-locked `events` table left them deny-by-default; `host_user_id`/`gym_template` stay revoked, reserved for slice P). The **mobile** create-event surface has now reached write parity for the typed model: `widgets/event_form_sheet.dart` (the `EventEditor` Dart twin) exposes the category segmented picker + `class` discipline free-text, and `SocialService.createEvent` persists `category` / `discipline` / `gym_template` (the latter built via `gymTemplateFromInputs` for a `class`) — so a typed event can be authored on Android, not just read. Slice **P1 (paid registration) has now shipped on web**: migration `20261229_001` lays the three tables (`instructor_payout_accounts` / `event_pricing` / `event_orders`) + `event_attendees.order_id` + the charges_enabled-gated pricing trigger + the service-role-only `event_orders.status` lock + the revoked `stripe_connect_account_id` column surfaced via `host_can_take_payment()`; the three Edge Functions (`events-connect-onboard`, `events-checkout` destination charge, `stripe-events-webhook` — the one idempotent, service-role-only, HMAC-verified order-status writer, deduped on the Stripe event id via the `webhook_events` table) are built; the web surfaces (`/settings/payouts` Connect onboarding + status, the EventEditor "Charge" toggle disabled until `charges_enabled`, the event-detail "Register · $X" flow with a `?paid=1` success poll) are built; the pure `paid_registration.ts` fee/sales-window/refund helper + `data.ts` methods (`fetchPayoutAccount` / `startConnectOnboarding` / `fetchEventPricing` / `setEventPricing` / `startEventCheckout` / `fetchMyOrder`) are built. **In-person only; web checkout only; refunds in P1 are MANUAL via the Stripe dashboard.** The **live charge path is UNVERIFIED** — no Stripe Connect test keys are configured (the existing Stripe surface is the RevenueCat-aggregated Pro path, not Connect), so real Connect onboarding + destination-charge Checkout + the webhook grant need operator `sk_test_` / `ca_` / `whsec_` keys ([local_testing_stubs.md § Stripe Connect](../testing/local_testing_stubs.md)); the schema rail, RLS (pgtap), pure helpers (node:test), the webhook/checkout pure libs (mocked-Stripe Deno tests), and the non-charge UI (Playwright) are verified. **Correction (2026-08-11):** that verified set did not include the price *write*, and the write was broken from the day P1 landed — `setEventPricing`'s upsert raised 42P10 on every call, so no event could ever be priced and the whole rail was unreachable even with keys configured. Fixed by migration `20270518_001` (one non-partial `nulls not distinct` arbiter) and pinned by `event_pricing_upsert_test.sql`; the per-instance price/refund lookups were separately picking the series row for every override (a timestamp string compare) and now go through `selectEffectivePricing`. See decisions §580 + §581. Compliance gate (owner + CISO + counsel sign-off for the new sub-processor under SOC 2 / GovRAMP) still applies before this is exposed in production. Slice **P2's buyer self-cancel + automated refund has now shipped on web** (migration `20270303_001`, decisions §187): the `events-cancel` Edge Function initiates a Stripe refund (refund-eligible `paid` order, `refund_application_fee: true`) or expires the soft reservation (`pending` order), and the `stripe-events-webhook` — still the sole status writer — handles `charge.refunded` to CAS `paid->refunded` + release the seat; the migration adds `event_orders.refund_initiated_at` (a non-status "refund requested" stamp the buyer may write) by widening `lock_event_order_status` from a status-lock to a column-lock; the web event-detail page gains a "Cancel registration" affordance (ConfirmDialog with refundable/no-refund/pending copy, `cancelEventOrder` in `data.ts`, a "Refund in progress" badge during the async gap). **The live refund round-trip is UNVERIFIED** — like P1's charge path it needs operator `sk_test_` / `whsec_` keys; the pure libs (Deno), the column-lock + buyer policy (pgtap `event_order_self_cancel_test.sql`), and the UI states (Playwright `event-self-cancel.spec.ts`) are verified, and the EF 503s fail-closed with keys unset. The remaining P2 work (waitlist notify-to-pay, reconciliation sweep) and P3–P4 (mobile register, virtual paid events, club-level pooled payouts) remain deferred. **The host's earnings summary has shipped on web** ([instructor_business.md M7](instructor_business.md), migration `20270723000001`, decisions § 1816): the `host_earnings_summary()` RPC reads `event_orders` scoped to the **payee** (`host_user_id = auth.uid()`, not the organiser policy) and returns registrations, gross, refunded, platform fee and net per class instance and currency, filed under the instance's month in `events.timezone`; `/settings/payouts` shows it per month with a per-class breakdown. Read-only, aggregates only, no buyer identity. Supersedes the `followups.md` "Paid event registration (~2-3 wk)" note (and corrects its sizing — E is a prerequisite the note missed, and the marketplace foundation is larger than the registration form). **E shipped first as the gate probe** (do non-running clubs even form?); P1's rail is now built behind it but stays gated on the compliance sign-off + operator Stripe keys before any production exposure. This replaces the earlier `paid_events.md` draft, which treated payments as the whole story and missed that events are running-shaped. **Cross-club discovery has now shipped (web)**: a `/social` **Discover** tab over the `search_public_events` RPC (migration `20270110_001`) lets anyone find public-club events across the typed model — filter by category (run/cycle/class/social), discipline (e.g. "pilates", pg_trgm index), cadence, weekday, free/paid, and **time-of-day** (local, anchored to a new `events.timezone` column captured at create time — migration `20270111_001`), and **proximity** ("near me / near a place" via `p_center_lng/p_center_lat/p_radius_m`, default 50km — migration `20270112_001`) — answering "find a paid pilates class on Sundays at 7pm near me" / "a weekly evening group run", which was previously impossible (events were reachable only inside a club you already knew). Proximity filters by the **club's** public `clubs.location_point` (geocoded by ClubEditor, GiST-indexed), **never** the event's revoked precise `meet_lat/meet_lng` — discovery is club-granularity by design so a class's exact studio/home address is never exposed; the web UI resolves a center via `geocodePlace` (typed place) or `navigator.geolocation` ("Use my location"). `security invoker` + public-club-scoped, so no new exposure; a mobile discovery surface is deferred. See [decisions.md §147](../architecture/decisions.md#147-cross-club-activity-discovery-is-one-security-invoker-rpc-scoped-to-public-clubs-surfaced-as-a-social-discover-tab).
>
> **Reused by charity fundraising ([fundraising.md](fundraising.md), migration `20270213_001`, ADR §167):** the Slice-P1 Connect rail is the foundation for fundraising/donation pages. A fundraiser uses the **same** user-level `instructor_payout_accounts` payout account + `host_can_take_payment()`, the same `events-connect-onboard` onboarding + `events-checkout/lib.ts` helpers, and the **same single `stripe-events-webhook` endpoint + secret** — extended with one `metadata.kind==='donation'` branch (`isDonationSession` → `donationStatusTransition`, the donation analogue of `orderStatusTransition`), not a second webhook. The `donations` ledger copies the `event_orders` discipline (service-role-only CAS status, donor identity / Stripe ids revoked, public feed via a SECURITY DEFINER RPC). Same fail-closed prod gate (live keys unset + owner/CISO/counsel sign-off).

## The two problems

1. **Events are running-specific.** The `/clubs/[slug]/events/new` editor and the event-detail page assume a *run*: attached route, distance, target pace, a race-mode arm/GO/finish loop, a results leaderboard with "Submit my time", finisher certificates, results CSV import/export, result claims ([clubs.md](clubs.md)). For a yoga or pilates class **none of that applies** — and worse, the event-detail page renders the results leaderboard + race-control affordances *unconditionally*, so a class would show a "Submit my time" button and an arm-as-race control. The domain leaks.
2. **No event is payable.** The only money column in the schema is `user_profiles.subscription_tier`; there is no per-event price, no host payout, no marketplace ([paywall.md](paywall.md)).

The user's framing resolves both: **clubs hold generic, typed events; the type drives which fields exist; price is orthogonal to type; payout follows the instructor.**

> **Related:** the race-director operations feature ([race_director_ops.md](race_director_ops.md), decisions §154) extends this same events layer in the other direction — turning "a club hosts an event" into "a race director runs a race" with offline aid-station check-in (`event_checkpoints` + `checkpoint_crossings`) feeding live results + cutoff projection, monetizable through the same Stripe Connect events rail.

## Product contract

Persona-led, so the design stays honest about who's using it:

- **Pilates instructor (Dani) with a studio club.** New event → picks **Class** → discipline "Reformer Pilates", Tuesdays 6:00pm, 50 min, studio address, **10 mats** capacity, **$22**. Members see "Register · $22", pay, and a paid registration *is* their spot; over capacity → waitlist. Dani never sees route / distance / pace / race controls. She onboarded a payout account once in her own settings; the $22 (minus the platform fee) lands in *her* Stripe account, not the club's. If she cancels Thursday's class, every paid registrant for that occurrence is auto-refunded.
- **Run club (the existing user).** New event → **Group run** → route, distance, target pace, optional race mode + leaderboard — exactly as today. Optionally free or paid (a coached track session, a supported long run). Nothing about the run flow regresses.
- **Casual meetup organiser.** New event → **Social** → just title, time, place, capacity. No athletic fields, no results.

Across all of them, **the create form shows only the fields the chosen type needs** (self-hiding), and **free vs paid is one flow** — paid just inserts a charge before the RSVP is granted.

## Slice E — typed events

Add a behaviour-driving **category** plus a free-text **discipline label**, and gate the athletic features on category.

### The category

`events.category` — a narrow client-side union **and** a CHECK constraint, kept in lockstep ([CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md), append to `check_constraint_unions.mjs` `PAIRS`):

```
EventCategory = 'run' | 'cycle' | 'class' | 'social'
```

The category names **align with the existing `ActivityType` union** (`run | walk | hike | cycle | stroller`, `types.ts`) deliberately — `cycle`, not `ride`, so the app does not grow two parallel vocabularies for the same concept. `EventCategory` is the *coarser, behaviour-driving* superset (it adds `class` + `social`, which aren't activity types); see the mapping below.

- **`run` / `cycle`** — distance-based athletic events. Course-shaped: route, distance, target pace, optional race-mode + results leaderboard + finisher certificate. Produce a `run`-family activity + `event_results`.
- **`class`** — instructor-led, fixed-location session (yoga, pilates, spin, strength, mobility, …). The *specific* discipline is the free-text label, not a category. No route/distance/pace/race/results. Capacity = mats/spots. Attendance, not ranking.
- **`social`** — a meetup. Title, time, place, capacity only.

`events.discipline` — **free text** (`'Vinyasa Yoga'`, `'Reformer Pilates'`, `'Track Tuesday'`). Display label only; **not an enum** (see [anti-patterns](#gotchas--anti-patterns) — hardcoding disciplines is the trap). Mirrors gym's free-text exercise names (`normaliseExerciseName`).

### Field & feature matrix by category

| Field / feature | run | cycle | class | social |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Title, date/time, duration | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Location / meet point + directions | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (studio) | ✓ |
| Capacity + waitlist | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (mats) | ✓ |
| Recurrence (weekly/biweekly/monthly) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| RSVP + attendee list | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Club feed posts + cancel-occurrence | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Discipline label (free text)** | optional | optional | ✓ | optional |
| **Attached route / distance / target pace** | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| **Race mode (arm/GO/finish)** | optional | optional | — | — |
| **Results leaderboard / "Submit my time"** | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| **Finisher certificate / CSV import-export / claims** | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| **Paid registration (price)** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

Everything in the top block is **shared** by every category (the genuinely generic event machinery — already built). Everything athletic self-hides for `class` / `social`. **Paid is orthogonal** — the last row applies to every category.

### Category → modality mapping (one type system, not two)

`EventCategory` is a coarse, behaviour-driving superset of `ActivityType`; the mapping is explicit so the two never drift:

| EventCategory | Maps to modality | Activity it produces when attended | Post-event artifact |
|---|---|---|---|
| `run` | running (`ActivityType` `run`/`walk`/`hike`) | a `run` row | `event_results` (race / leaderboard / certificate) |
| `cycle` | running modality, `ActivityType` `cycle` | a `run` row tagged `cycle` | `event_results` |
| `class` | **gym modality** | a `gym_workout` (see below) | attendance (no `event_results`) |
| `social` | none | nothing | attendance |

This is why category names track `ActivityType` (`cycle`, not `ride`): an event's category names *which modality it belongs to*, and the multi-modal app already has a vocabulary for that.

### Post-event artifact by category

- `run` / `cycle` → a logged `run`-family activity + an `event_results` row (race mode, leaderboard, rank, certificate). Unchanged.
- `class` → **attendance** + an **optional logged `gym_workout`** (the designed cross-modal seam — see next). The `event_attendees` `going` row is the attendance record. **No rank, no certificate, no `event_results` row** — a class is not a race.
- `social` → attendance only.

### The class → gym seam is designed, not a footnote

A paid pilates class the user attends **must be able to land in their Train → Gym history and feed the same recovery/load curve their runs do** — otherwise clubs are a bolt-on and the cross-modal-intelligence thesis ([multi_modal.md](multi_modal.md)) doesn't hold for the marketplace. So the connection is part of the contract, even though the *write* may ship after P1:

- A `class` event carries an optional **`gym_template`** hint on the event — a typed `{discipline, duration_min}` jsonb shape (the free-text discipline doubles as the workout title; the default duration is its own field). The host sets it in the editor; an attendee one-tap-creates a `gym_workout` from it (their own row, their own data — the event only *suggests* it, never writes to the attendee's log without consent).
- **This now ships (web + mobile).** The host write goes through `EventEditor` → `createEvent` (class-only; a class the host didn't template writes `gym_template = NULL`, not `{}`, so the attendee affordance self-hides). The attendee read goes through the event-detail "Log this as a workout" button (web `/clubs/[slug]/events/[id]`, mobile `event_detail_screen.dart`), gated on `category === 'class'` **AND** a non-null `gym_template` **AND** a signed-in viewer — a run/cycle/social event never shows it. The button **pre-fills the canonical composer** (web `GymEditor`, mobile `gym_compose_sheet`) from the template (`workoutDraftFromTemplate`: discipline||event-title → title, duration_min×60 → duration_s; sets stay empty); nothing writes until the user confirms inside the composer.
- The typed contract lives in a parity-paired pure helper — web `social/event_gym_template.ts` ↔ mobile `event_gym_template.dart` (`parseGymTemplate` / `gymTemplateFromInputs` / `workoutDraftFromTemplate`) — so the host-write and attendee-read paths share one tolerant parser instead of poking raw jsonb at each call site.
- The read path needs a column grant: `events` is column-SELECT-locked (`20260818_001`), and `20261228_001` left `gym_template` revoked ("reserved for slice P"). Migration **`20261230_001`** grants `SELECT (gym_template)` to `authenticated` + `anon` (mirrors the category/discipline grant); `host_user_id` stays revoked. Pinned by pgtap `event_gym_template_grants_test.sql`.
- This keeps the [§63 data-trust tiers](multi_modal.md#integration-model--inform-tier-1-vs-command-tier-2) intact: attending-logs-a-workout is *inform* (the user confirms in the composer); nothing auto-mutates a plan or the attendee's log.

### Backfill

Every existing event predates the column and is run-shaped → migration defaults `category = 'run'`. The editor must never strand a legacy event without a category.

### Defense in depth, not just hidden UI

Hiding the leaderboard/race controls for a class in the client is **not enough** — a non-athletic event must be *un-race-able and un-result-able at the data layer too*. Extend the `race_sessions` and `event_results` write paths (RLS / trigger) to reject inserts when the parent `events.category NOT IN ('run','cycle')`. A yoga class arm-as-race via a direct API call must 403, not just be invisible.

## Slice P — paid registration

Free and paid registration are **one primitive, two flows** — never a separate "tickets" entity divorced from RSVP:

- **Free event:** "I'm in" → `event_attendees` row (`going` / `waitlisted`), exactly as today.
- **Paid event:** "Register · $X" → Stripe Checkout → a completed order is what writes the `going` row (with an `order_id` FK). No payment, no slot.

The price lives on the event (per-occurrence, with an optional per-instance override for a recurring class — a one-off workshop priced higher than the weekly session). The host must have a payout account with `charges_enabled` before a price can be set (CHECK-backed trigger, not just UI).

### Drop-in registration — no club-join required (verified)

The marketplace's core case is a **drop-in**: someone pays for one class without joining the club as a member. This already works at the policy layer — the `event_attendees` INSERT policy is `auth.uid() = user_id OR organiser`, gated only by event *visibility* (`is_public` club OR member, per `20260428_001`). So a **signed-in non-member can register for (and pay for) a public club's class** today; slice P inherits that. Two constraints to honour:

- **Checkout must not silently join the club.** Registering for a class is a *purchase*, not a membership act — a drop-in student is a customer, not a community member. Don't bundle a `club_members` insert into the registration flow (the host can invite them to join separately).
- **A logged-out stranger must sign up before paying.** Registration requires `auth.uid()` (you can't charge or seat an anonymous attendee). The class link → "Sign in to register" → checkout. This is the marketplace's top-of-funnel and the one unavoidable friction; private-club classes stay member-only by design.

## The load-bearing decision: the app-store tax

A paid thing unlocked *inside* a mobile app is, by default, a **digital good** — and Apple Guideline 3.1.1 / Google Play Billing then force their **30% IAP cut** and forbid routing to Stripe (the same rule that forces the Pro subscription through RevenueCat → StoreKit, see [paywall.md § Regional availability](paywall.md#regional-availability--international-payments)).

**The escape hatch — and it fits classes even better than runs.** Apple and Google both *exempt* **real-world / in-person services and physical event tickets** from IAP (Apple 3.1.3(e) "real-time person-to-person services" / 3.1.5(a) physical services; Google Play physical-goods-and-services carve-out). A live **in-person yoga/pilates class** is the canonical real-world service — closer to a gym day-pass or a concert ticket than to unlocking a feature. So Stripe-on-web is permissible even from mobile for these.

Consequences:

1. **P1 is in-person only** (`event_modality = 'in_person'`). A **virtual / livestream** class *is* a digital good and re-opens the 30% requirement — deferred (P4, behind a legal decision).
2. **The classification is legally load-bearing — counsel signs off before P1.** Starting web-first contains the risk: web carries no app-store tax regardless of how Apple classifies it.
3. **Web takes Stripe directly** (~2.9% + Connect fees, no 30% cut). P1 is web-checkout only even from mobile (see [UI](#web--mobile-ui)).

## The validation gate (stated honestly)

The roadmap has **zero** commitment to typed/paid events ([roadmap.md](../product/roadmap.md)). This is net-new product surface + money movement + third-party-merchant onboarding under SOC 2 / GovRAMP scope — it does not ship on momentum.

Mirroring the gym engine's "relocate the gate, don't jump it" sequencing ([gym_programming.md § The validation gate](gym_programming.md#the-validation-gate-stated-honestly)):

- **Slice E is the cheap probe.** It ships typed events with no money and asks: *do non-running clubs / events even get created?* A yoga instructor can run a **free** class properly the day E lands — a self-contained win. If meaningful non-`run` event creation appears over 4-6 weeks, the marketplace (P) is justified. If every event stays a `run`, freeze at E; the payment build is unwarranted.
- **The bet:** clubs with a professional instructor want to schedule (and eventually monetize) non-running sessions.
- **The explicit tradeoff:** E builds the typed model before any monetization signal — but it's low-cost, additive, and independently useful, so the downside is small. P (the expensive Connect + compliance work) stays gated on E's signal.
- **Owner + CISO + counsel sign-off before P** — the IAP classification, PCI scope, and the expanded sub-processor / DSAR footprint (see [Compliance](#compliance-soc-2--govramp--privacy)).

## Money movement — to the host, not the club

**Stripe Connect, destination charges, with `application_fee_amount`.** The buyer's card is charged on the platform account; funds transfer immediately to the **host's** connected account; the platform's cut is the application fee. The platform never touches their banking data.

> **The host is NOT the merchant of record, and this section said for months that they were** (corrected 2026-08-28, [decisions § 769](../architecture/decisions.md)). Naming the host as settlement merchant is `on_behalf_of`, and `buildCheckoutSessionParams` does not send it — Stripe: *"If `on_behalf_of` is omitted, the platform is the business of record for the payment."* So the buyer sees the **platform's** statement descriptor and the charge settles in the platform's country and fee structure. Chargebacks are the platform's either way: *"For destination charges, with or without `on_behalf_of`, Stripe debits dispute amounts and fees from your platform account."* Whether to send `on_behalf_of` is a **pre-deploy sign-off question** (it moves settlement currency and card-statement identity, and it is **required** for a host outside the platform's region, which `buildAccountCreateParams` already lets a caller onboard via its `country` argument) — and `/terms` §6 no longer contradicts it: the buyer-facing page was rewritten on 2026-09-08 to say Threkir is the merchant of record and the host provides the event, and `20270713000001` writes the same claim onto `event_orders` and `donations` as table comments so `\d+` states it too ([decisions § 1603](../architecture/decisions.md)).

**The payout account is on the host, not the club** — this is the core of "clubs shouldn't have anything specific":

- `events.host_user_id` (default = creator) names who gets paid. A studio club with a yoga instructor *and* a pilates instructor → each instructor hosts their own classes and receives their own money. The club is just the container they're listed under.
- Onboarding is a **user-level** surface (`/settings/payouts`), done once, reused across every club the host teaches in. **Not** a club setting.
- A **club-level pooled payout account** (for clubs that want all event revenue to land in one place) is a deliberate **P4 deferral** — most instructor cases want money to the person, and pooling adds a "who controls the club's bank account" governance problem.

Flow:

- **Onboard:** `events-connect-onboard` Edge Function → Stripe Account Link (Express account) → hosted KYC/bank/tax. `account.updated` webhook flips `charges_enabled` / `payouts_enabled` in `instructor_payout_accounts`.
- **Checkout:** `events-checkout` validates the sales window + capacity, creates a destination-charge Checkout Session against the host's account with the platform fee, inserts a `pending` order holding a reserved slot (TTL).
- **Confirm:** `stripe-events-webhook` (separate from `revenuecat-webhook`, own HMAC secret, idempotent on Stripe event id) handles `checkout.session.completed` → `paid` + write attendee row, **but only once `payment_status` says the money arrived** (a delayed-notification method completes the Session `unpaid`, decisions § 785); `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded` → the same path days later; `checkout.session.async_payment_failed` → `failed` + release slot; `charge.refunded` → demote + promote waitlist; **`refund.failed` / `refund.updated` / `charge.refund.updated`** → the refund-lifecycle trio: if the *refund's own status* is `failed` or `canceled`, CAS `refunded -> refund_failed` and leave the seat alone (decisions § 789); `account.updated` → sync flags; `checkout.session.expired` → release slot.
- **Payouts:** Stripe's job, on the host's schedule. The platform fee is new company marketplace revenue — **loop in finance** (distinct from subscription revenue, new tax treatment). The operator reads what it earned, per UTC month and per host + club, net of refunds, at `/admin/earnings` (app_admins only, decisions § 1817).

## Capacity, waitlist & the payment race

Reuses the shipped `enforce_event_capacity` + `promote_event_waitlist` machinery ([clubs.md § Event detail capabilities](clubs.md#event-detail-capabilities)). Hard studio capacity (10 mats) makes correctness *more* important for classes than for group runs:

- **Soft reservation:** creating a Checkout Session inserts a `pending` order that **counts toward capacity** for `reserved_until` (~15 min, matching Stripe's session TTL), so two buyers can't pay for the last mat simultaneously. Expired pendings are swept (a `jobs` kind or a `reserved_until < now()` read filter).
- **Confirm-time capacity recheck** at `checkout.session.completed` (not at session creation). If the class filled via another path, the paid registrant is **auto-refunded and notified** — holding a stranger's money for a maybe-slot is the wrong default.
- **Waitlist promotion never auto-charges.** When a mat frees, a waitlisted user is **notified to complete payment** (`event_waitlist_slot` notification + checkout link + short claim window), never charged silently.
- **One live hold per buyer, and the Stripe session is keyed to it.** `events-checkout`'s idempotency key is the pending `event_orders.id`, and every field of the Checkout Session body — including `expires_at` — is derived from that order's persisted `created_at`, never from the request clock. Stripe's idempotency contract is joint: a key replayed with a body that has moved is answered `idempotency_error`, not with the original session, and the key is retained ~24 h. The original `(buyer, event, instance)` key spanned every hold that pair would ever open while the body carried a fresh `order_id` and a `Date.now()`-derived expiry, so a genuine double-click 502'd — and kept 502'ing for a day (decisions §632). A re-click inside the live 15-min hold now reproduces the request byte for byte and Stripe hands back the session already open; the hold's `reserved_until` is deliberately **not** extended, so it can never outlive the 30-min session backing it. A hold that has lapsed is **superseded**: its session is expired at Stripe (the resulting `checkout.session.expired` CASes that order `pending -> canceled` through the webhook, still the sole status writer) before a replacement opens, because two payable sessions for one registration is a double-charge. The capacity precheck is skipped on the reuse path — the caller's own reservation is inside the count, so re-checking it would 409 `event_full` on a double-click for a class the caller had themselves filled.

## Refunds & cancellation coupling

Extends the shipped cancel-occurrence (`event_exceptions`) + `notify_event_cancel` flow:

- **Host cancels an occurrence** → every registrant is refunded in full, whatever the refund policy says (the host cancelled, not the buyer). **Built (M8, [decisions § 1818](../architecture/decisions.md)):** the spec's `refund_orders_for_instance` is `events-cancel` with `scope: 'occurrence'`. It checks the caller organises the club (`can_cancel_event_occurrence`), answers `503 stripe_not_configured` *before cancelling anything* if the occurrence holds an order and Stripe is unset, records the `event_exceptions` row (closing checkout; `notify_event_cancel` fans out as before), then expires each `pending` reservation and refunds each `paid` / `partially_refunded` order through the same `refundOrder` helper, `buildRefundParams` shape and per-order idempotency key (`event-order-refund:<order id>`) as the buyer path, so a retried cancel, or a buyer cancel followed by the host's, never refunds twice. The webhook flips each order to `refunded` and releases the seat as for any refund. A failed refund leaves the occurrence cancelled and the order charged; the response says which (`refunds.outcome: 'incomplete'`), and the event page lists, per cancelled occurrence, what is still owed / in flight / sent back by the bank, with a **Refund now** that re-sends the same request. **A paid occurrence cannot be called off any other way:** `guard_paid_occurrence_cancel` (migration `20270723000003`) refuses a client insert into `event_exceptions` while the occurrence holds money, and the web hands that refusal to the function. **Not yet:** the cancel notification does not carry a "you've been refunded" line (followups.md).
- **Buyer self-cancels** → honoured per `event_pricing.refund_policy` (`full_until_start | full_until_24h | no_refund`); freeing the slot triggers waitlist promotion → notify-to-pay.
- **A PARTIAL refund keeps the registration.** Stripe emits `charge.refunded` for a partial refund too, so the webhook branches on the charge's own `refunded` boolean (with `amount_refunded` vs `amount` as the arithmetic fallback): a full refund CASes `paid -> refunded` and releases the seat, a partial one CASes `paid -> partially_refunded` and **keeps** it. Before `20270521_001`'s companion webhook change, a $5 goodwill refund on a $50 workshop flipped the order to `refunded`, deleted the buyer's seat and let `promote_event_waitlist` give it away — for a registration still 90 % paid. Unknown or missing amounts fall back to `full` (the historical behaviour, and the safe direction for the buyer).
- **A paid order seats exactly one instance.** The `enforce_paid_order_for_priced_event` trigger matches the cited order on `instance_start` as well as buyer/event/status, so an order bought for one Wednesday cannot seat the other 51 in a recurring series (`20270520_001`), and a partial unique index on `event_attendees(order_id)` states "one order, one seat" at the schema level.
- **A refund reverses the destination transfer AND the application fee — both, or the platform pays for the cancellation.** `events-cancel` sends `reverse_transfer: true` **and** `refund_application_fee: true` (`buildRefundParams`), because Stripe couples them: *"If you refund the application fee for a destination charge, you must also reverse the transfer."* The two flags do opposite things and neither is optional here. `reverse_transfer` pulls the host's share back out of their connected account — without it *"the destination account keeps the funds that were transferred to it, leaving the platform account to cover the negative balance from the refund."* `refund_application_fee` does **not** claw our cut back to us, which is what this line used to claim: it *"push[es] the application fee funds back to the connected account"*, and it is what leaves the host whole once the reversal has taken the ticket off them. Until 2026-08-28 only the second was sent, so on a cancelled $50 class at 250 bps the platform was debited the full **$50.00** and then paid the host a further **$1.25** — the host netting **$50.00** for a class nobody attended, the platform **−$50.00**, on every single cancellation ([decisions § 769](../architecture/decisions.md)). With both flags a full refund nets every party to zero (less Stripe's own processing fee, which is never returned).
- **A refund that FAILS is a fourth outcome, and it does not restore the seat.** `charge.refunded` fires when a refund is *created* — including one Stripe holds `pending` because our balance does not cover it — so the seat is released before the money's fate is known. If the bank then rejects it, the funds come back to us and Stripe emits `refund.failed` (or `refund.updated` / the deprecated `charge.refund.updated` on an endpoint pinned below API version `2024-10-28.acacia`). The webhook gates on the **Refund's own status** (`failed` / `canceled`; `requires_action` and `pending` are still in flight) and CASes `refunded -> refund_failed` on whichever ledger owns the payment intent. `refund_failed` is excluded from every seat predicate and from `fundraiser_totals` by construction — Stripe's guidance for a failed refund is to "arrange an alternative way to provide your customer with a refund", which is a human action. **The operator worklist is `payment_refunds`, not the status** (`20270630000001`, decisions § 823): every refund-lifecycle delivery upserts one row keyed on the Stripe Refund id, so `select * from payment_refunds where status in ('failed','canceled')` answers for both money ledgers, for partial as well as full refunds, **with the amount** — where `where status = 'refund_failed'` names the order and `event_orders` carries no refunded amount to name. **`partially_refunded` transitions on nothing**: it is a seat-bearing status (`enforce_paid_order_for_priced_event`, the buyer-cancel RLS policy), so moving a partly-refunded order out of it would take the roster entry and the cancel button off a buyer who is still attending and lost nothing — the failed partial is recorded on the child row instead, which is where the money always belonged. Migrations `20270624000001` + `20270630000001` + `20270701000001`, decisions § 789 + § 823 + § 825.
- **And the payer is told, on both ledgers.** § 789's `refund_failed` was an operator worklist with no reader: the buyer's seat was gone, the money had not arrived, and nothing said why. A `refund_failed` **notification kind** (migration `20270701000001`, [decisions § 825](../architecture/decisions.md)) is written by an `after update of status` trigger on each ledger, on the TRANSITION only — so a redelivered webhook, which CASes against the status it read and updates no row, announces nothing. One row, because the `notifications` fan-out already becomes the inbox entry, the email and both pushes in all seven locales; and because on the donation side it is the only surface that can exist (`donations` has no client SELECT policy, so a donor cannot read their own row anywhere). The order arm carries `event_id` so the CTA reaches `/clubs/[slug]/events/[id]`, where a banner outside the registered block says the same thing at length and points at `billing@threkir.com` — the address `/terms` § 5 already names for refund requests. An **anonymous** donation (`donor_user_id` null) cannot be reached by this rail and stays a worklist item; the trigger guards on it so a 23502 cannot roll the ledger move back.

- **A refund issued from the Stripe *dashboard* has the same hazard and no code to protect it.** The dashboard's refund dialog reverses nothing unless the operator ticks it, and `charge.refunded` will be processed by the webhook either way. Host cancellations no longer need the dashboard (§ 1818), so this is now the goodwill / dispute / donation case. **Pre-deploy ops item:** any manual refund on an event order or a donation must reverse the transfer, or the platform absorbs it.
- **A partially-refunded registration is still cancelable, and used to silently do nothing.** `partially_refunded` is a held seat (`enforce_paid_order_for_priced_event` accepts it, `20270522_001`), so `cancelAction` now decides it exactly as `paid`: refund what is still owed and release the seat. It previously read as terminal while `events-cancel` selected such an order and the buyer policy admitted it, so the EF answered `action: 'noop'`, the web toast said *"reservation released"*, and no refund was created and no seat freed.
- **The refund policy is disclosed pre-purchase** (2026-07-14, US legal review of the Terms): the event-detail register box renders the policy line under the price, before the Register CTA — not only at cancel time (FTC "clear and conspicuous before purchase"). Pinned in `event-paid-register.spec.ts`; the buyer-facing contractual framing (**platform** as merchant of record with the host as event provider, per-policy refunds, host-cancel full refund) lives in `/terms` §6, corrected 2026-09-08 ([decisions § 1603](../architecture/decisions.md)).

### Pre-deploy sign-off checklist (money flow)

The Stripe functions are gated on owner + CISO + counsel sign-off ([decisions § 139](../architecture/decisions.md)) and fail closed with `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` unset (503 `stripe_not_configured`). The **code path is fully built**; these are the items to settle at deploy time, not work to schedule:

- [ ] **`on_behalf_of`: is the host the settlement merchant, or the platform?** Today it is the platform (see § Money movement). `/terms` §6 was reconciled to that on 2026-09-08 and now tells both the buyer and the host so, which means the sign-off no longer has one document arguing for it — flipping the parameter is now a rewrite of every rail rather than a correction of one. Required, not optional, for any host outside the platform's region. **Sending it is a copy change as well as a money change**: `payouts.merchantNote` now tells the host the platform is merchant of record, in seven locales, and `apps/web/src/routes/settings/payouts/merchant_note_guard.test.ts` and `apps/web/src/routes/terms/merchant_of_record_guard.test.ts` both fail the moment a checkout call site sends the parameter — the second covering the buyer-facing page and both money-ledger table comments — so the flip cannot land while four rails still say the opposite.
- [ ] **Chargeback liability is the platform's** on a destination charge regardless of that choice. The host-onboarding copy said the reverse until 2026-09-07 — `payouts.merchantNote` told the instructor they owned refunds and chargebacks — and now says a disputed charge is debited from the platform's Stripe account, in all seven locales. It is the one merchant-of-record clause the pending `on_behalf_of` sign-off cannot vindicate either way, so what is left here is the sign-off acknowledging the liability, not a copy fix.
- [ ] **A transfer reversal can leave a connected account negative.** Confirm who covers it (`controller.losses.payments`), and whether `debit_negative_balances` should be on — a host paid out before a late cancellation has nothing left to reverse against. Untestable without operator `sk_test_` keys.
- [ ] **Manual dashboard refunds must reverse the transfer.** Runbook item for whoever holds the Stripe dashboard. Host-cancel refunds are automated since [decisions § 1818](../architecture/decisions.md); what remains manual is goodwill, dispute and donation refunds.
- [ ] **Run one host cancel end to end in test mode.** `events-cancel` `scope: 'occurrence'` on a class with two test-mode registrations: both refunds created with `reverse_transfer` + `refund_application_fee`, both orders `refunded` via the webhook, a second identical request answering `already_refunded` / replaying rather than refunding again. Unverifiable without operator `sk_test_` keys.
- [ ] **Reconcile the donations already flipped to `refunded`.** A partial refund on a donation *is* representable now (`20270620_001`: `partially_refunded` + `refunded_cents`, decisions § 776), and `fundraiser_totals` reports what the charity kept. What the migration cannot repair is the rows the pre-§769 behaviour flipped to `refunded` on a partial refund: the amount that actually came back exists only at Stripe. `status = 'refunded' and refunded_cents = 0` is exactly that cohort — see `fundraising.md § Reconciling pre-§769 refunds`. Nil today (the surface has never been live), so this is a checklist item for whenever it stops being nil.
- [ ] **The endpoint's `enabled_events` list must include `refund.failed`, `refund.updated` AND `charge.refund.updated`.** All three are handled ([decisions § 789](../architecture/decisions.md)), but an event that is not enabled on the endpoint is never delivered — so with any of the three missing the reversed-refund arm never fires and the failure mode is exactly the silent one it was written to close. Which three matter depends on the endpoint's pinned API version, which is why all three are subscribed rather than a chosen pair. Unreadable from this repo in any form; a dashboard check.
- [ ] **Record the endpoint's pinned API version and check it against `2024-10-28.acacia`.** At or above it the endpoint receives `refund.failed` / `refund.updated`; below it, only the deprecated `charge.refund.updated`. The webhook now logs which era each refund delivery belongs to — grep `stripe refund event era:` for the verdict and the raw `api_version` Stripe stamped on it ([decisions § 826](../architecture/decisions.md)) — so this item is "read the log line once after the first refund delivery and write the version down here", not a dashboard expedition. Pinned version: **_unrecorded — no endpoint exists yet_**.
- [ ] **The live refund round-trip is still UNVERIFIED.** Everything above is typechecked, unit-tested and source-guarded; nothing here has been run against Stripe in any mode.

## Data model

Additive columns on `events` (slice E):

- `category` (`EventCategory`, NOT NULL, default `'run'`, CHECK-constrained).
- `discipline` (text, nullable — free-text display label).
- `host_user_id` (uuid FK → `auth.users`, default = creator; names the payout recipient).
- `gym_template` (jsonb, nullable — only meaningful for `category = 'class'`; the typed `{discipline, duration_min}` an attendee's one-tap "log this as a workout" pre-fills. **Shipped (web + mobile, inform-tier).** Cross-user `SELECT` granted by `20261230_001` (the column-locked `events` table left it deny-by-default); parsed through the `event_gym_template.ts` ↔ `.dart` parity pair).

Additive column on `event_attendees` (slice P):

- `order_id` (nullable FK → `event_orders`; NULL for free events; CHECK-backed trigger requires a `paid` order for a `going`/`waitlisted` row on a priced event).

New tables (slice P; both type generators must run — [schema_codegen.md](../architecture/schema_codegen.md)):

- **`instructor_payout_accounts`** — `user_id` PK, `stripe_connect_account_id`, `charges_enabled` / `payouts_enabled` / `details_submitted` (mirrored from Stripe by webhook), `country`, `default_currency`, `onboarded_at`. **No bank/tax/SSN data** — Stripe holds it. RLS: own-row only; the connected-account id is revoked from `anon`/`authenticated` SELECT (surface a boolean "can take payment" via a view, the `get_event_meet_point` pattern in [clubs.md](clubs.md)).
- **`event_pricing`** — `(event_id, instance_start)` (NULL instance = whole series; non-null overrides one occurrence), keyed by a single non-partial `unique … nulls not distinct` so the upsert has an inferable `ON CONFLICT` arbiter (`20270518_001`, decisions §580 — the two partial indexes it replaced made every price write fail with 42P10). `price_cents` (>0), `currency`, `modality ∈ {in_person}` (v1; `virtual` reserved), `refund_policy ∈ {full_until_start, full_until_24h, no_refund}`, `sales_close_offset_minutes`. RLS: readable with the event; writable by `is_event_organiser(club_id)` **and** only when the host has `charges_enabled` (trigger-enforced). Pick the row governing one occurrence with `selectEffectivePricing` (web `social/event_instance.ts`, EF `_shared/event_instance.ts`) — an instance timestamp reaches the client in two renderings of the same instant, so a `===` on it silently misses every override (decisions §581).
- **`event_orders`** — the ledger. `id` PK, `event_id`, `instance_start`, `buyer_user_id`, `host_user_id`, `stripe_checkout_session_id`, `stripe_payment_intent_id`, `amount_cents`, `currency`, `platform_fee_cents`, `status ∈ {pending, paid, refunded, partially_refunded, refund_failed, failed, canceled}`, `created_at`, `paid_at`, `refunded_at`, `reserved_until`. No refunded-amount column — see `payment_refunds` below. RLS: buyer reads own; host reads orders for their events; **writes are service-role only** (webhook is the sole writer — the `subscription_tier` lock pattern, [paywall.md § Tiers](paywall.md#tiers)).

New narrow unions (TS + CHECK lockstep; append to `check_constraint_unions.mjs` `PAIRS`):

- `EventCategory = 'run' | 'cycle' | 'class' | 'social'` (names track `ActivityType`)
- **`payment_refunds`** — one row per Stripe Refund on either money ledger (`20270630000001`). `stripe_refund_id` unique (a webhook redelivery is an upsert, never a second row), exactly one of `donation_id` / `event_order_id`, `amount_cents`, `status ∈ {pending, requires_action, succeeded, failed, canceled}`, `failure_reason`. **No client role can read it** (`revoke all`, no policy); writes are service-role-only and a terminal status latches, so an out-of-order `pending` cannot un-say a `refund.failed`.
- `OrderStatus = 'pending' | 'paid' | 'refunded' | 'partially_refunded' | 'refund_failed' | 'failed' | 'canceled'`
- `RefundPolicy = 'full_until_start' | 'full_until_24h' | 'no_refund'`
- `EventModality = 'in_person'` (`'virtual'` added when P4 lands)

No new `runs.metadata` keys (relational, not jsonb) → no [metadata.md](../backend/metadata.md) churn.

## Web & mobile UI

Web-first per [decisions.md § 24](../architecture/decisions.md#24-web-is-the-canonical-feature-surface-mobile-and-watches-are-platform-additive):

- **`EventEditor` (web, `/clubs/[slug]/events/new` + edit)** — **type-first**: step 1 picks the category (Group run · Cycle · Class · Social) with a one-line description each; the rest of the form is rendered *by category* so a Class never shows route/distance/pace/race. A free-text "Discipline" field appears for Class. A "Charge for this event" toggle (disabled with an explainer until the host has `charges_enabled`) reveals price / currency / refund policy / sales-close offset. Per-series vs per-occurrence pricing follows the existing recurrence picker.
- **`/clubs/[slug]/events/[id]` (web)** — the page composes **by category**: a Class shows time / studio map / capacity / attendee list / register button — and **no** leaderboard, race control, or "Submit my time"; a run shows the existing athletic surface. On a priced event the RSVP row becomes "Register · $X" → Stripe → `?paid=1` success reflecting the confirmed RSVP (poll fallback for webhook latency, the <5s pattern in [paywall.md](paywall.md)).
- **`/settings/payouts` (web, user-level)** — Connect onboarding entry ("Set up payments to host paid events"), `charges_enabled` status, re-entry to Stripe's dashboard. **User-level, not per-club.**
- **Mobile (Android/iOS)** — typed-event *creation* now ships on mobile too: `widgets/event_form_sheet.dart` exposes the category picker + `class` discipline and `SocialService.createEvent` writes `category` / `discipline` / `gym_template`. Mobile also **renders typed events read-only and composes by category** (a class hides the athletic surface, same gating logic, byte-identical twin per [§ 39](../architecture/decisions.md#39-mobile_android-and-mobile_ios-share-a-byte-for-byte-dart-codebase)). **Paid registration on mobile is P3** and routes to **web checkout in a Custom Tab / in-app browser** (the in-person-service exemption permits it, but it's deferred to keep P1's blast radius + IAP-classification risk contained). In P1, mobile has no register/checkout flow — a priced event shows the price read-only (no purchase path), and registration + payment happen on web. Never add a `BYPASS_PAYWALL`-style override here ([paywall.md § Mobile](paywall.md#mobile--watch--other-web-endpoints)).
- **Watch** — out of scope entirely (no purchase, no creation).

## Compliance (SOC 2 / GovRAMP / privacy)

Money movement + a new sub-processor make slice P the most compliance-heavy feature in the app. **Loop in the CISO / Security Analyst and counsel before P1** (org policy for SOC 2 / GovRAMP-scoped changes):

- **PCI scope:** **Stripe-hosted Checkout + onboarding keeps us at SAQ A** (card data never touches our servers/bundle). **Do not build a custom card form** — that escalates PCI scope dramatically. Hard constraint.
- **New sub-processor:** Stripe Connect processes buyer *and* host personal/financial data → add to the sub-processor list + Privacy Policy (`/audit/third-party-data-flows`).
- **DSAR / deletion:** `event_orders` + `instructor_payout_accounts` are new personal-data tables → into the GDPR export (Art 20) + deletion (Art 17) paths (`/audit/data-export-completeness`, `/audit/account-deletion-completeness`). **Tension:** financial records carry a legal retention requirement (tax/AML) that can override erasure — orders likely retain (anonymized) past account deletion; counsel sets the term, documented in the GDPR posture.
- **GovRAMP:** payment flows are not GovRAMP-scoped and must not process government/regulated data — standard separation.
- **Funds-flow integrity:** webhook is the sole writer of order status (service-role RLS), HMAC-verified, **idempotent on Stripe event id** (a replayed `checkout.session.completed` must not double-grant a mat or double-count revenue).

## Gotchas & anti-patterns

The user explicitly asked these be ironed out. **Anti-patterns (do not do):**

1. **Don't build a parallel "Classes" feature / table / tab.** One `events` table; `category` drives behaviour. *Why events keeps a `category` column when `runs.kind` was dropped (§63, migration `20261206_001`):* `runs.kind` was a cross-table polymorphism replaced by the `activities` view injecting a literal per UNION branch — different problem. `events.category` drives **UI field visibility within one editor + one detail page**, where the optional field sets genuinely diverge. It's a discriminant for presentation + feature-gating, not a join key.
2. **Don't hardcode yoga / pilates / spin as enum values.** Broad `category` for behaviour + **free-text `discipline`** for the label (the gym free-text-exercise precedent). A rigid discipline enum needs a migration for every new class style — exactly the brittleness to avoid.
3. **Don't make "paid" a separate entity from the event / RSVP.** Price is a property of the event; a completed order gates the existing RSVP. No parallel "tickets" model.
4. **Don't put the payout account on the club.** Money follows the **host** (`host_user_id`); onboarding is user-level. Clubs stay generic. (Club-level pooling is a P4 governance decision, not a default.)
5. **Don't render athletic affordances on non-athletic events.** Route / distance / pace / race mode / leaderboard / "Submit my time" / certificate / CSV / claims must each be gated on `category` — **today they render unconditionally**, which is a live bug for a class. Gate in UI *and* at the data layer (next item).
6. **Don't rely on hidden UI for safety.** Block `race_sessions` + `event_results` writes for `category NOT IN ('run','cycle')` at RLS/trigger level — a class must be un-race-able via direct API, not merely invisible.
7. **Don't build a custom card form.** Stripe-hosted Checkout = SAQ A; a custom form explodes PCI scope.
8. **Don't auto-charge a waitlisted attendee on promotion.** Notify-to-pay with a claim window.
9. **Don't reuse the RevenueCat / subscription path, and don't let the money land anywhere but the host's account.** Stripe Connect destination charges into `events.host_user_id`'s connected account, with the platform's cut as the application fee. **Not** "the host is merchant of record", which this item asserted until 2026-09-07 and `/terms` §6 asserted until 2026-09-08: `on_behalf_of` is absent, so the platform is the business of record for the payment and carries the chargebacks — see [§ Money movement](#money-movement--to-the-host-not-the-club).
10. **Don't let a user-JWT write `event_orders.status`.** Webhook-only (service role), idempotent.
11. **Don't give a class a rank / certificate / `event_results` row.** Classes are attendance, not results.

**Gotchas (watch for):**

- **Backfill** existing events to `category = 'run'`; the editor + detail page must handle a legacy event gracefully (never a null category).
- **`runs.event_id` assumes a run** — a class produces no run, so don't require the backlink or a `run_id` for class attendance.
- **Recurrence + per-instance pricing:** a weekly class priced per session; a cancelled occurrence refunds *only that instance's* orders (the `event_exceptions` coupling), not the series.
- **Confirm-time capacity** for paid classes — hard studio capacity makes oversell worse; reserve at checkout, recheck at webhook.
- **Currency:** host's settlement currency vs buyer's card currency — Stripe converts + shows the buyer their localized amount; store the order in the host's currency.
- **Time zones:** a recurring class's `instance_start` is ISO; ensure attendee/spectator surfaces render it in the viewer's local zone (a 6pm class must not show as 1am to a member in another zone).
- **Host loses `charges_enabled` mid-series** (KYC lapse) → block new registrations with a clear host-facing error; existing paid registrations unaffected.
- **DSAR vs financial retention** (above) — orders aren't freely erasable.
- **Twin parity** for any Dart pure helper (fee math / sales window / category-gating predicate); **i18n** for the new category labels + discipline placeholder + register/price strings in all six web gen-l10n catalogues + all mobile ARBs.
- **Accessibility:** the category picker + price field need labels; the register button needs explicit loading / sold-out / sales-closed states (`/audit/accessibility`, the `/ux-hunt` checklist).
- **Webhook replay idempotency** on Stripe event id (above).

## Failure modes

Per the [layered-resilience contract](../architecture/conventions.md#layered-resilience) — a payment-layer failure must never corrupt the free-event flow:

- **Charge succeeds, attendee write fails** → idempotent webhook retries; reconciliation grants the slot or refunds if the event vanished. Never a `paid` order with no slot and no refund.
- **Webhook never arrives** → success-page poll + periodic reconciliation vs Stripe's API; buyer sees "processing", not a false failure.
- **Capacity race** → soft reservation + confirm-time recheck; invariant: never oversell.
- **Refund fails at Stripe** → surfaced to host + ops, order flagged `refund_failed`, retried; user told a refund is in progress, never silently dropped. For a host cancel the refund that fails to be *created* is reported per order to the host (`refunds.outcome: 'incomplete'`) and stays on the event page with a **Refund now** until it succeeds (§ 1818).
- **A class accidentally created as a `run`** (or vice-versa) → category is editable (**shipped on web**, issue #335: `EventEditor` edit mode via the "Edit event" button on the detail page + `updateEvent`); switching to a non-athletic category hides + (at the data layer) blocks the athletic features, and warns first (`ConfirmDialog`, fail-safe) if results/race data already exists.

## Testing

Per the [test-hygiene rule](../architecture/conventions.md#test-hygiene--review-then-unit-then-e2e) (review → unit → e2e):

- **Unit (web):** the category→field-visibility predicate, capacity-reservation math, sales-window logic, refund-policy resolution, fee computation. Pure, no Stripe.
- **e2e (web, Playwright):** create a Class (assert no route/distance/pace/leaderboard rendered) and a Group run (assert they *are*); Stripe **test mode** end-to-end — onboard a test Connect account, price a class, register with `4242…`, assert the RSVP; cancel the occurrence, assert refund + demotion. Stubs per [local_testing_stubs.md](../testing/local_testing_stubs.md).
- **e2e (backend, Deno/pgtap):** category-gated race/result writes 403 for a class; webhook idempotency (replay = one grant); RLS (buyer can't read another's order; non-host can't price; user-JWT can't write order status); confirm-time capacity decision.
- **Wiring guards (Deno, source-level):** the money paths' pure libs can't see whether the handler asks them, and neither can run without operator Stripe keys — so `events-checkout/wiring.test.ts` and `stripe-events-webhook/wiring.test.ts` read `index.ts` and pin the positional properties: the Checkout body is anchored on the order (never on the clock) and keyed on the order, a reused hold's reservation is not extended, a superseded session is expired before its replacement opens, the refund arm classifies the charge amounts, and the seat release is gated on the resulting STATE rather than on the event name.
- **Twin parity:** any Dart pure helper joins the [lockstep list](../../CLAUDE.md). E's category-gating predicate that lands in Dart is the first such pair.

## File list

Slice E (web + backend):

- `apps/backend/supabase/migrations/20261227_001_typed_events.sql` — `events.category` / `discipline` / `host_user_id` / `gym_template` + CHECK + backfill + the `race_sessions`/`event_results` category guards; `20261228_001_typed_events_column_grants.sql` grants cross-user `SELECT (category, discipline)` (the column-locked `events` table left them deny-by-default); `20261230_001_grant_gym_template_select.sql` grants `SELECT (gym_template)` for the class→gym seam.
- `apps/web/src/lib/social/event_category.ts` — pure category→capabilities predicate (parity-paired).
- `EventEditor` + `/clubs/[slug]/events/[id]` (web) + mobile `event_detail_screen.dart` — compose by category.
- Regenerate both type files; add `EventCategory` to `types.ts` + `check_constraint_unions.mjs`.

Slice P (web + backend):

- `apps/backend/supabase/migrations/20261229_001_paid_events.sql` — the three tables + `event_attendees.order_id` + RLS + CHECK + capacity/refund trigger extensions.
- `apps/backend/supabase/functions/events-connect-onboard/index.ts`, `events-checkout/index.ts`, `stripe-events-webhook/index.ts` (separate from `revenuecat-webhook`).
- `apps/web/src/lib/social/paid_registration.ts` — pure fee/sales-window/refund helpers.
- `apps/web/src/lib/core/data.ts` — `fetchEventPricing` / `startEventCheckout` / `fetchPayoutAccount` / `startConnectOnboarding` / host registrations summary.
- `apps/web/src/routes/settings/payouts/+page.svelte`; `EventEditor` price toggle; `/clubs/[slug]/events/[id]` register button.
- Add `OrderStatus` / `RefundPolicy` / `EventModality` to `types.ts` + `check_constraint_unions.mjs`.
- Secrets: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_CONNECT_CLIENT_ID`, `STRIPE_EVENTS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — Supabase function env, never client-readable.

Slice P2 (web + backend) additions:

- `apps/backend/supabase/migrations/20270303_001_event_order_self_cancel.sql` — `event_orders.refund_initiated_at` + the buyer refund-stamp UPDATE policy + `lock_event_order_status` widened to a column-lock.
- `apps/backend/supabase/functions/events-cancel/{index,lib,lib.test}.ts` — buyer self-cancel EF (initiate-only; never writes status); `stripe-events-webhook` extended to handle `charge.refunded` (sole status writer) and the `refund.failed` / `refund.updated` / `charge.refund.updated` reversal trio (decisions § 789).
- `apps/backend/supabase/tests/event_order_self_cancel_test.sql` — pgtap for the column-lock + buyer policy.
- `apps/web/src/lib/core/data.ts` — `cancelEventOrder`; `apps/web/src/routes/clubs/[slug]/events/[id]/+page.svelte` — Cancel-registration affordance + refund-pending badge; `apps/web/tests-e2e/clubs/event-self-cancel.spec.ts`.

Host cancel → refund every registrant (M8, decisions § 1818):

- `apps/backend/supabase/migrations/20270723000003_host_cancel_refunds.sql` — `can_cancel_event_occurrence` + the `guard_paid_occurrence_cancel` trigger; pgtap `apps/backend/supabase/tests/host_cancel_refunds_test.sql`.
- `apps/backend/supabase/functions/events-cancel/` — `scope: 'occurrence'`, the shared `refundOrder` helper, `refundIdempotencyKey` / `hostCancelAction` / `summarizeOccurrenceRefunds` in `lib.ts`, pinned by `lib.test.ts`, `refund_invariants.test.ts` and `wiring.test.ts`.
- `apps/web/src/lib/core/data.ts` — `cancelEventInstance` hands a refused paid cancel to `cancelPaidEventInstance`; `fetchCancelledOccurrenceRefunds`. Pure `occurrenceRefundState` / `cancelledOccurrenceRefunds` / `parseOccurrenceRefundSummary` in `social/paid_registration.ts`. The refund panel + cancel-dialog note on the event page; `apps/web/tests-e2e/clubs/event-host-cancel-refunds.spec.ts`.

## Phasing & rollout

| Slice | Scope | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| **E** (proposed first) | Typed events (`category` + `discipline`), self-hiding athletic fields, data-layer race/result guards, backfill. **No money.** Web create + web/mobile read. A free yoga/pilates/social event works properly. | Owner sign-off (low-risk, additive) |
| **P1** ✅ shipped on web (live charge path unverified — needs operator Stripe test keys) | Stripe Connect onboarding + destination-charge checkout + one webhook, **in-person only**, **host payouts**, web checkout only, manual refunds via Stripe dashboard. Migration `20261229_001` + the three Edge Functions + `/settings/payouts` + the EventEditor Charge toggle + the event-detail Register flow. | E shows non-`run` events get created; owner + CISO + counsel sign-off |
| **P2** ✅ buyer self-cancel + automated refund coupling shipped on web (live refund round-trip unverified — needs operator Stripe test keys); waitlist notify-to-pay + reconciliation sweep still deferred | Buyer self-cancel per `refund_policy` → `events-cancel` EF initiates the Stripe refund / reservation release; `stripe-events-webhook` (still the sole status writer) flips `paid->refunded` on `charge.refunded` + frees the seat. Migration `20270303_001` (`event_orders.refund_initiated_at` + the status-lock→column-lock + buyer refund-stamp policy) + the event-detail Cancel affordance. Decisions §187. **Host cancel → refund every registrant** (the spec's `refund_orders_for_instance`) is built too: `events-cancel` `scope: 'occurrence'` + `guard_paid_occurrence_cancel` / `can_cancel_event_occurrence` (migration `20270723000003`) + the per-occurrence refund panel on the event page. Decisions § 1818. | P1 conversion signal |
| **P3** | Mobile register (web-checkout handoff), payout summary, receipt + refund emails (extend [email.md](email.md)). **The class→gym seam (attended class → one-tap log a `gym_workout` from `gym_template`) has SHIPPED early** (web + mobile, inform-tier — it's orthogonal to the paid path, so it didn't wait on P2). | P2 stable |
| **P4** | Class-pass / recurring memberships (re-opens the IAP subscription bucket), **virtual/livestream paid events** (digital-good IAP decision), discount codes, **club-level pooled payouts**. | Separate product + legal decision |

## Open questions

1. ~~**Platform fee rate**~~ — **decided 2026-10-07: 500 bps (5%) on paid events**, held in `platform_fees` (service-role only) and read by `events-checkout` at charge time; the rate actually charged is recorded on each order as `platform_fee_cents` (decisions § 1768). Below ~3% + 30c a destination charge loses money, because Stripe's processing fee is the platform's.
2. **Paid-buyer-lands-on-waitlist** — auto-refund (spec default) vs hold-as-paid-waitlisted. Confirm.
3. **Account-deletion vs financial retention** term for `event_orders`. Counsel.
4. **Connect account type** — Express (Stripe-hosted dashboard, fastest; P1 assumption) vs Standard.
5. **Is hosting paid events itself a Pro-host perk?** — ties into the existing paywall.
6. **Do we need `cycle` in v1**, or is `run | class | social` enough until cycling events appear? (Adding a category later is a migration + union + CHECK triple.)

## Rough sizing

- **Slice E:** ~1-1.5 wk (column + backfill + category-gated rendering on web + mobile + the data-layer guards + tests). Low risk, additive.
- **P1:** ~4-5 wk to a defensible slice — the registration flow (~2-3 wk the followup noted) **plus** the Connect foundation (onboarding, webhook, capability sync, reconciliation) **plus** the compliance/legal pass that can't be skipped.
- **P2-P3:** ~2-3 wk each. **P4:** a separate initiative.

## Appendix A — proposed ADR

Ready to lift into [decisions.md](../architecture/decisions.md) at the next free number when approved (the gym + multi-modal-redesign specs also hold unlanded numbers — assign sequentially at landing). Its merchant-of-record clause was corrected on 2026-09-07 to match what the code does, so a later lift does not enshrine the claim § 769 disproved:

> **§N. Club events are typed (`run | cycle | class | social`, names aligned to `ActivityType`) with self-hiding fields; paid registration is an orthogonal Stripe Connect marketplace whose payouts go to the event host, not the club.** Clubs are generic containers. The event model was running-specific (route/distance/pace/race/results rendered unconditionally), which broke instructor-led classes. Decision: add `events.category` (a presentation + feature-gating discriminant — *not* a join key, distinct from the dropped `runs.kind`; names track the existing `ActivityType` union so the app keeps one type vocabulary, with an explicit category→modality mapping where a `class` maps to the gym modality) + a free-text `events.discipline` label (no discipline enum, mirroring gym's free-text exercises); gate every athletic affordance on category in UI **and** at the data layer (a class is un-race-able via direct API). A `class` event is attendance-only with a designed (if later-built) seam to log a `gym_workout` for the attendee, so the marketplace participates in the cross-modal model rather than bolting on. Paid registration is orthogonal to category: price is a property of the event, a completed Stripe Checkout order gates the existing RSVP (no separate tickets entity), and funds settle into the **host's** connected account (`events.host_user_id`) via destination charges with an application fee — the payee is the host, never the club, while the **platform** stays the merchant of record for the payment (`on_behalf_of` is not sent; whether to send it is a pre-deploy sign-off, § Money movement). Onboarding is user-level (`/settings/payouts`), reusable across clubs; club-level pooled payouts are deferred (P4). P1 is in-person-only + web-checkout-only because in-person services are IAP-exempt (Apple 3.1.3(e)/3.1.5; Play physical-services carve-out) whereas a virtual class is not; web carries no app-store tax regardless. Hosted Stripe Checkout keeps PCI scope at SAQ A; the webhook is the sole, idempotent, service-role-only writer of order status. Supersedes the `followups.md` "Paid event registration" note. Slice E (typing, no money) ships first as the gate probe; P (the marketplace) is gated on E showing non-running events get created.

## Appendix B — roadmap edits

When E lands: in [roadmap.md](../product/roadmap.md) under Clubs and events, add a "Typed events (run / class / social)" row (E-shipped). When P1 lands, add "Paid events (marketplace)" (P1-shipped / P2-P4 planned) and **remove the `followups.md` "Paid event registration" line** (this spec supersedes it). Flip [parity.md](../product/parity.md) cells (web ✓; mobile read ✓ / register ✗ until P3; watch ✗).

## Appendix C — docs-to-update (when each slice lands)

- [clubs.md](clubs.md) — the event model is now typed; the athletic surface (race mode, results, certificates) is `run`/`cycle`-only; mobile Social no longer hosts routes (per the [multi_modal.md redesign](multi_modal.md#proposed-redesign-pending-sign-off--the-train-hub--routes-relocation)); add the paid-registration subsection.
- [paywall.md](paywall.md) — cross-reference: the marketplace path is separate from the Pro/RevenueCat path; note the two webhooks.
- [api_database.md](../backend/api_database.md) — the new columns + three tables + RLS + the revoked connected-account-id column + the category-gated race/result guards.
- [integrations.md](integrations.md) — Stripe Connect as a payment integration (distinct from data-sync integrations).
- [email.md](email.md) — P3 receipt + refund job kinds.
- The GDPR posture docs + sub-processor list (counsel-reviewed).
- `parity.md`, `roadmap.md` per Appendix B; both type files regenerated; `check_constraint_unions.mjs` `PAIRS` updated for `EventCategory` / `OrderStatus` / `RefundPolicy`.
