/// The active-run tile is an L4 auxiliary effect on an L1 path.
///
/// `RunRecordingService` nudges the tile from four places and three of
/// them run inside `onStartCommand` — start, pause, resume — where a
/// throw does not degrade a feature, it reaches the thread's uncaught
/// handler and ends the process with the run in it. The start-path call
/// is the worst of the four: it sits between publishing `Recording` and
/// subscribing GPS, HR, steps, the ticker and the checkpoint job, so a
/// throw there loses a run that the foreground service, the wake lock
/// and the open track file all say is under way.
///
/// The AndroidX call chain was read rather than assumed (decisions
/// § 1053): `TileService.getUpdater` only allocates, and the "no Tiles
/// host" case is the one AndroidX itself handles — `buildUpdateBindIntent`
/// logs and returns null. What is unisolated is the composite it returns,
/// which calls `Context.bindService` on one delegate and
/// `Context.sendBroadcast` on the other with no catch between them, and
/// `bindService` is documented to raise `SecurityException`.
///
/// Source-level, in the idiom of `SensorStreamResilienceTest`: neither
/// ProtoLayout nor a Tiles host is drivable from the host JVM.
