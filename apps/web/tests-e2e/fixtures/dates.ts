/**
 * Day-relative timestamps for seeded rows, built in the zone the BROWSER runs
 * in rather than the one the Node process happens to be in.
 *
 * `playwright.config.ts` pins every browser context to `timezoneId: 'UTC'`, so
 * a page that buckets rows into "today" resolves that day in UTC. A spec that
 * seeds with `new Date(y, m, d, 12, 0)` builds the day in the *runner's* zone
 * instead. The two agree only while the local and UTC calendar dates agree —
 * for part of every day in most zones they do not, the row lands on the
 * adjacent day, the surface renders nothing, and a visibility assertion fails
 * on a timeout that says nothing about why. Hosted CI runners are UTC, so the
 * seam is invisible there and red at home. See decisions.md § 728.
 *
 * Every day-relative seed goes through this module. `dates.test.ts` scans the
 * spec sources for local-zone day derivation, so a new spec cannot quietly
 * re-derive the bug.
