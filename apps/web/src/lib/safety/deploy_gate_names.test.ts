// Every cross-platform fail-closed deploy gate's env-var NAME, on both
// platforms at once. Invocation:
//   npx tsx --test src/lib/safety/deploy_gate_names.test.ts
//
// The convention every mobile gate's header states is "web spells it
// `PUBLIC_<X>`, mobile drops the web-only `PUBLIC_` prefix". It is a real
// operational claim rather than a style one: an operator flipping a gate for a
// release reads one name and sets the other, so a pair whose STEMS differ means
// they have signed one platform off and not the other, silently, in exactly the
// direction the gate exists to prevent.
//
// Nothing tested it, and it turned out to be false for one of the four. Web
// reads `PUBLIC_WEIGH_IN_ENABLED`; mobile reads `WEIGH_IN_GATE`. The Dart
// header meanwhile named `PUBLIC_WEIGH_IN_GATE`, a variable no file in the repo
// reads or sets, so the one place a reader could have learned about the
// exception told them the opposite (decisions § 1354).
//
// So the exception is DECLARED here and re-measured, rather than the convention
// being weakened to fit it: a gate whose names start agreeing fails as a stale
// exemption, and a fourth gate that quietly breaks the convention fails as a
// new one. The KEYS themselves are read out of the source, never listed — a
// list of names would go stale the same way the header did — and the census
// walks `src/lib` for `*_flag.ts` so a gate this file has never heard of fails
// rather than going unmeasured, which is how `nearby_flag` was found missing
// from the first draft of this very list.
//
// The Dart mirror is `apps/mobile_android/test/deploy_gate_names_test.dart`,
// which makes the same measurement from the other tree.
