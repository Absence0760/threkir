// Guardrail: a CI failure is seen, and names what actually failed.
//
// Rules 1 and 2 come from one incident; rule 3 is the floor underneath them —
// a diagnosis nobody is shown is worth no more than a misattributed one. `parity-types` ended in a bare
// `- if: failure()` step that printed "database.types.ts is out of sync with
// the Supabase schema" and told the reader to run `npm run gen:types`. A step
// condition of `failure()` is true for a failure ANYWHERE earlier in the job,
// so a web source-guard failure five steps above printed that message — a
// confident statement about a migration and a generated file, neither of which
// was involved, which is where the first look went.
//
//   1. No step conditioned on `failure()` may print an `::error::` annotation
//      unless its condition also names a specific step's outcome. This is the
//      shape of the bug, and it is repo-wide: an artifact upload behind
//      `if: failure()` is fine (it claims nothing), a DIAGNOSIS behind one is
//      a claim the condition cannot support.
//   2. Every check step of a BUNDLED job carries its own `::error::`. Rule 1
//      alone would be satisfied by deleting the trailing step and saying
//      nothing at all; the reason that job needs per-step diagnoses is that it
//      bundles unrelated checks — migration guards, a CHECK-vs-TS-union guard,
//      the whole web unit suite, and the type-drift check — under one job name,
//      so the job name cannot say which one broke and each step has to say it
//      for itself.
//
// Which jobs those are is DERIVED, not listed. It used to be listed, and the
// list is what failed: `parity-matrix` has bundled four unrelated registry
// guards since the day it was written, was never added, and its absence was
// filed and deferred twice before anyone reached it — while `workflow-lint`
// (five guards) and env-isolation's `unit` (two) were never noticed at all.
// That last job is now ci.yml's `env-isolation` — the workflow it lived in was
// folded in and deleted (decisions § 862), which is also why rule 3 below can
// reach it.
// A job that runs more than one of this repo's own guards is bundled by that
// fact; nothing has to remember to say so (decisions § 764). DIAGNOSING_JOBS
// survives for the bundles the derivation cannot see — `edge-functions` runs
// `deno test`, not a guard script — and a listed job that no longer exists
// still fails rather than reading nothing.
//
// Not applied to every `run:` step in the file: most jobs run one thing, and
// their name already says what it was. A single-guard job like
// `watch-ble-uuids` is exactly that case, and is deliberately untouched.
//
//   3. Every job in ci.yml is named in the `CI gate` aggregator's `needs:`
//      list. That aggregator is the single required status check, and it
//      passes when every job it needs passed OR was skipped — so a job absent
//      from the list is a check whose RED does not block a merge and shows up
//      only as one more green-looking row among thirty. Nothing enforced this:
//      the list was complete by hand, and a job is added to this file far more
//      often than anyone re-reads the bottom of it. A `needs:` entry naming no
//      job fails too, because a deleted job leaves a name the aggregator will
//      never hear from.
//
//   4. That aggregator's own verdict is derived from the jobs it waits for.
//      Rule 3 is only half of what makes a merge blocked and the other half
//      lived in a shell block nothing read: drop the job's `if: always()` and
//      GitHub skips the gate on exactly the runs where something failed (a
//      skipped required check holds nothing); stop reading the `needs` context
//      and the gate passes over a red job; read every result and never exit
//      non-zero and the failure is printed as text on a green check. All three
//      leave rule 3 satisfied, so all three were reachable (decisions § 909).
//
//   5. No message a step prints hands part of itself to the shell to run. A
//      backtick inside a double-quoted word is command substitution, and this
//      repo's prose quotes identifiers in backticks everywhere, so the two
//      habits meet inside an `::error::` string and bash deletes exactly the
//      identifier the sentence exists to name. Measured on the committed
//      workflows: `parity-matrix` told the reader a cell held "a symbol outside
//      , a  with no Notes" and printed two "command not found" lines beside it.
//      Rules 1-4 all passed on it — the annotation fired, from the right step,
//      in a job the gate waits for. They are about whether a diagnosis is
//      ATTRIBUTED correctly; this one is about whether it is DELIVERED.
//
//   7. A workflow that runs on a PULL REQUEST either reaches the required
//      status check or is DECLARED advisory with a reason. Rule 3 makes every
//      job in `ci.yml` block a merge; nothing said anything about the other
//      workflows, and a `needs:` entry cannot name a job in a sibling file. So
//      a scanner in a file of its own runs on every PR, goes red on a finding,
//      and merges anyway — which is what `gitleaks.yml` did for its whole life
//      until § 1264 moved it behind a called job. The remedy is not always the
//      fold: `security.yml` is refused it on a measured reason, and
//      `pr-title-lint.yml` triggers on `edited`, which is how a RETITLE
//      re-lints and which `ci.yml` deliberately does not carry. What the rule
//      buys is that each of those is a decision on the record rather than an
//      omission, and that the next PR-triggered workflow is one too
//      (decisions § 1537).
//
//   8. The two DOCUMENTS that describe the merge gate say what that register
//      holds. Rule 7 makes the advisory set a decision in code; nothing tied
//      it to the prose an operator or a contributor actually reads, and both
//      were already wrong about it. `docs/ops/deployment.md § Merge gates`
//      explained the same five decisions by hand and named neither the
//      register nor the guard, and the root `CLAUDE.md` said a red `lint
//      title` "fails the PR on open" — which is what the row looks like and
//      not what it does, `pr-title-lint.yml` being a workflow of its own that
//      nothing waits for. So the section's advisory list is compared with
//      `PR_ADVISORY` in BOTH directions, the section has to name the register
//      and the gate job's display name, and every sentence in CLAUDE.md that
//      names an advisory check has to call it advisory. Rule 6's shape one
//      document over: a prose claim is a transcription of something this file
//      already parses, and an anchor matching nothing is a hard error rather
//      than a silent pass (decisions § 1585).
//
// THE SUBJECT IS PER RULE, and stated in the output. For this file's whole
// life every rule read `.github/workflows` and nothing else, so the two
// composite actions under `.github/actions` were outside all of them at once
// — `check_workflow_binaries.mjs` and `check_toolchain_pins.mjs` both read that
// directory, and this one silently did not. Rules 1 and 5 read a step's `if:`
// and its shell, which an action step has, so they read both directories; rules
// 2, 3 and 4 are about JOBS — bundling, the gate's `needs:`, the gate's own
// verdict — and an action has none, so widening them would have been a claim
// about nothing. `RULE_SUBJECTS` records which is which with the reason, and
// the guard prints the split rather than leaving a reader to infer it. An empty
// action list is a FAILURE, not a quiet skip, because "covered workflows only"
// is precisely the state that went unnoticed (decisions § 1215).
//
// Line-based rather than YAML-parsed on purpose: the `workflow-lint` job runs
// `node` against a bare checkout with no `npm ci`, so only the stdlib is
// available. Same constraint check_toolchain_pins.mjs works under.
//
// Reads: `.github/workflows/*.yml` (every rule) + `.github/actions/*/action.yml`
//        (rules 1 and 5 — see RULE_SUBJECTS).
//
// Run: `node scripts/check_ci_diagnostics.mjs`
// CI:  the `workflow-lint` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml, which is in the
//      `CI gate` aggregator's `needs:` list.
// Unit tests: `node --test scripts/check_ci_diagnostics.test.mjs`
