/// the second instalment does have something to write, and returning null here
/// would leave the charity's thermometer overstating by the difference.
///
/// Before 20270620_001 a partial refund returned null outright, because
/// `fundraiser_totals` summed `amount_cents` filtered on `status = 'paid'` and
/// flipping a partly-returned donation to `refunded` removed its WHOLE amount
/// from the thermometer — a 5 USD goodwill refund on a 500 USD donation erased
/// 500 USD of it. That was the lesser of two lies, not an answer; the ledger
/// can now state the real one. decisions § 769, § 776.
///
/// `refund_failed` mirrors the order ledger and is reachable only from
/// `refunded` for a second reason of its own: `fundraiser_totals` sums
/// `amount_cents - refunded_cents` over ('paid', 'partially_refunded'), so a
/// `refund_failed` row drops out of the thermometer exactly as `refunded`
/// does — correct, because the money is owed back to the donor rather than
/// raised for the charity. Moving a `partially_refunded` donation there
/// instead would remove the WHOLE donation from the total including the part
/// that was never refunded, which is a larger error than the one it fixes; and
/// the only alternative — subtracting the failed instalment from
/// `refunded_cents` — is arithmetic on a running total, which is precisely
/// what § 769 avoided so that an at-least-once redelivery cannot double-apply.
