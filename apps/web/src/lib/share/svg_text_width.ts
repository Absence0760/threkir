/**
 * An advance-width estimate for a single-line SVG `<text>`, and the clipper
 * that spends it.
 *
 * The og:image cards paint their title into one `<text>` node, which neither
 * reflows nor clips: anything past the box paints over the artwork and off the
 * card. What bounded it was a GRAPHEME-CLUSTER budget, which is the right unit
 * for a `<meta>` description a reader counts (decisions § 1528) and the wrong
 * one for a box measured in pixels — one cluster is 0.24 em of `'` and 1.0 em
 * of `東`, a factor of four under one number.
 *
 * Measured against the shipped renderer (`@resvg/resvg-js` 2.6.2, the card's
 * own 56 px bold face) by rasterising and reading the ink extent, 30 clusters
 * in the 1120 px box:
 *
 *     lowercase Latin `n`     1142 px      CJK Han                1678 px
 *     a realistic Latin name   952 px      Hangul                 1544 px
 *     uppercase Latin `M`     1645 px      running-figure emoji   1634 px
 *     Cyrillic `ш`            1571 px      flag (RI pair)         2013 px
 *
 * So the overrun was never only CJK: a route named in capitals overran the box
 * by 525 px under a budget written for lowercase.
 *
 * ## Why an estimate and not a measurement
 *
 * The card is built as a string and rasterised elsewhere, so nothing on this
 * side can ask the renderer how wide a glyph is; and `font-family` is a stack
 * ending in `sans-serif`, so the face is the HOST's and differs between the
 * dev server, CI and the Lambda. An exact answer is not available to any
 * caller. What is available is a bound, and a bound is all a clipper needs.
 *
 * `ASCII_ADVANCE_EM` is therefore the widest advance each printable ASCII
 * character takes across six bold sans faces (the shipped stack as resolved on
 * a Fedora host, DejaVu Sans, Liberation Sans, Noto Sans, Arial, Helvetica),
 * rounded UP to 0.01 em. It is a font-metrics approximation, not a derived
 * truth — there is no generator to re-run and no table to keep in lockstep,
 * because the answer depends on a font this repo does not ship. Nothing keys
 * on it: it decides where an ellipsis goes.
 *
 * The claim it has to keep is one-sided — the estimate must never fall BELOW
 * what the renderer paints — and that is checked by behaviour rather than by
 * re-deriving numbers: `svg_text_width.render.test.ts` rasterises each script
 * class and fails if the ink outruns the estimate.
 *
 * ## Why the table alone is not the bound
 *
 * The table was measured on ONE host, and a table of font metrics cannot be
 * more universal than the machine it was read on. Measured against a second
 * host (the CI runner, whose `sans-serif` resolves to a different face) the
 * same strings paint up to **11.2 %** wider than the table says — Cyrillic
 * 1774 px against 1596, ASCII punctuation 1035 against 935, lowercase Latin
 * 1187 against 1142. So a table presented as "the widest advance across six
 * faces" was a bound on the six, and the host is not obliged to use one of
 * them.
 *
 * `HOST_FACE_MARGIN` is the answer, and it is deliberately not a seventh
 * measurement: the Lambda's face is a third unknown and the next host a
 * fourth, so chasing them is a treadmill the estimate would keep losing. The
 * margin covers the measured cross-host spread more than twice over. It costs
 * a slightly earlier clip on a narrow face, which is the safe direction — an
 * over-clipped title is legible, an overrun one paints off the card.
