-- The five functions decisions § 799 kept anon-executable because something
-- anon can already reach NAMES them, exercised through the thing that names
-- them.
--
-- A policy expression and a view body are privilege-checked against the
-- QUERYING role, not against their owner — § 746's trap, one object class over.
-- So a sweep that withheld `is_challenge_visible` would not merely hide a row:
-- an anonymous read of a public challenge's participants would raise `42501:
-- permission denied for function is_challenge_visible`, and the same for
-- `is_event_visible` on three event tables and the three `is_public_*_by_id`
-- helpers inside the two public views.
--
-- Two of the five are load-bearing and three are not, and the difference is
-- measured here rather than assumed. A POLICY expression is privilege-checked
-- against the querying role, so `is_challenge_visible` and `is_event_visible`
-- genuinely need anon's EXECUTE — withholding either turns a logged-out read
-- into a 42501, which the mutation below reproduces. A VIEW body is not, unless
-- the view is `security_invoker`: `public_runs` and `public_routes` are not, so
-- their three `is_public_*_by_id` calls are evaluated as the view's owner and
-- anon's grant on them is belt-and-braces. § 799's allowlist gives "named by
-- the public_runs view" as the reason to keep those three, which is true of the
-- reference and not of the privilege. The coupling is asserted at the end, so
-- flipping either view to `security_invoker` — a plausible hardening change —
-- cannot silently make three unneeded grants load-bearing without anything
-- saying so.
--
-- `anon_execute_contract_test` asserts the grants are held, which is the shape
-- of the rule. This asserts the surfaces answer, which is the rule's reason —
-- and the two fail differently: a blanket `revoke ... from public, anon` over
-- the schema leaves the contract test's allowlist entry stale (it fails, loudly
-- and correctly) while THIS file names the logged-out page that went dark.
--
-- Every read is issued as `anon` with no claims, which is what PostgREST does
-- for a request bearing the publishable key. Each is paired with a private
-- sibling the same read must NOT return, so a helper that started answering
-- `true` unconditionally is caught here too rather than read as health.
