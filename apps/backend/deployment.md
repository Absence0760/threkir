# Backend deployment plan

How `apps/backend/` (the whole Supabase project — Postgres, Auth, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions, pg_cron) runs in production.

This file is the operational counterpart of [`apps/backend/CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) (which describes the schema + EF + helpers) and [`apps/backend/local_testing.md`](local_testing.md) (the local stack). For the cross-service overview see [`docs/ops/deployment.md`](../../docs/ops/deployment.md). Tag-driven release mechanics live in [`docs/ops/releasing.md`](../../docs/ops/releasing.md).

**Status: live on the Free tier** (raw `<ref>.supabase.co` URL, no custom domain, no automated backups — see "Provider and tier"). The Pro-tier items below are the documented upgrade path, not the current state.

---

## Provider and tier

**Provider:** Supabase Cloud.

**Tier: Free ($0) today.** The prod project runs on the Free tier for the lean launch —
clients use the raw `https://<ref>.supabase.co` URL (the value in `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` /
`MOBILE_SUPABASE_URL`), there is no custom domain, no daily backups, and the project
auto-pauses after 7 days idle (see [`docs/ops/deployment_lean.md`](../../docs/ops/deployment_lean.md)
§ Rock-bottom risk). **Pro ($25/month) is the planned upgrade**, to be bought the moment real
users exist; it buys:

- Daily backups + Point-In-Time Recovery (free tier has no automated backups)
- Custom domain (`api.threkir.com` — additionally needs the paid custom-domain add-on)
- Larger compute (4 GB RAM minimum) — the materialized-view refresh + the run-write trigger fan-out push the free tier's 1 GB instance into swap fast as soon as bulk Strava imports run
- 8 GB Storage included (raw track gzips are ~10 KB each; 1k users × 200 runs ≈ 2 GB → fits Pro for the foreseeable)
- Removal of the 1-week pause on inactive projects

**Region:** `eu-west-2` (London). Picked because most expected early users are EU/UK and the cross-Atlantic latency adds 70–100 ms to every PostgREST round trip. Switch to `us-east-1` if the user mix shifts; the migration is a one-time `pg_dump | pg_restore` window.

**Compute add-ons:** none at launch. Revisit when:
- p95 query latency on the dashboard query exceeds 500 ms (Supabase Reports → Database → Query Performance)
- A background job's runtime becomes the dominant compute draw (this line used to name the `mv_weekly_mileage` refresh; that matview was dropped unread in `20270530_001` and the repo now runs no matview refresh at all)

---

## One-time project setup

```bash
# 1. Create the Supabase Cloud project in the dashboard (Free tier today — see
#    "Provider and tier"; eu-west-2).
# 2. From a local clone:
cd apps/backend
supabase login                     # opens browser for OAuth
supabase link --project-ref <ref>  # ref is the slug from the dashboard URL
```

The `supabase link` step writes `.temp/project-ref` and `.temp/cli-version` (gitignored). Don't commit them.

```bash
# 3. Push the migration history.
supabase db push
# → applies every file under supabase/migrations/ in order.
# → on a fresh project, expect a few minutes for the PostGIS extension
#   create + the initial seed-shape migrations.
```

After the first push, set up the cron extension and the schedules. They're idempotent:

```bash
supabase db reset --linked   # NEVER on a project with real users.
                             # Use during the initial bring-up only.
```

**`supabase db reset --linked` warning.** It drops every table and replays migrations from scratch. Safe before launch; catastrophic after. The CI workflow that handles `backend@*` does *not* call `--linked` — it uses `db push`, which only applies migrations that haven't been applied yet.

---

## Edge Function deploys

```bash
# Deploy one:
supabase functions deploy parkrun-import --project-ref <ref>

# Deploy all seven at once (this is what the release workflow does):
for fn in parkrun-import refresh-tokens strava-import strava-webhook \
          revenuecat-webhook delete-account export-data; do
  supabase functions deploy "$fn" --project-ref <ref>
done
```

**EF environment variables** are set per-project via `supabase secrets set`. Required:

```bash
cd apps/backend

supabase secrets set --project-ref <ref> \
  PARKRUN_USER_AGENT="run-app/1.0 (+https://threkir.com/bot)" \
  STRAVA_CLIENT_ID="..." \
  STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET="..." \
  STRAVA_VERIFY_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 16)" \
  STRAVA_WEBHOOK_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET="..."   # paste from RevenueCat dashboard \
  SENTRY_DSN="..."                  # backend Sentry project DSN; empty disables \
  APP_RELEASE="backend@$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)"
```

`SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are auto-injected by the platform — you don't `supabase secrets set` those.

**Strava OAuth callback URL.** Once the project is live, set the Strava developer dashboard's redirect URL to `https://threkir.com/auth/strava/callback`. The `strava-import` EF expects to receive the OAuth `code` from a client-side POST after the redirect lands on the web app.

**RevenueCat webhook URL.** In the RevenueCat dashboard → Project → Integrations → Webhooks, set:
- URL: `https://<ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/revenuecat-webhook`
- Auth header: `Authorization: Bearer <REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET>`

**Strava webhook URL.** Once you're issuing OAuth tokens you'll need to call `POST https://www.strava.com/api/v3/push_subscriptions` with our callback URL `https://<ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/strava-webhook?secret=<STRAVA_WEBHOOK_SECRET>` and the `STRAVA_VERIFY_TOKEN`. Strava verifies, persists the subscription, and starts firing events.

---

## Custom domain — `api.threkir.com`

**Not provisioned.** Custom domains require a paid plan plus the custom-domain add-on; on
the current Free tier this subdomain does not resolve and every client uses the raw
`https://<ref>.supabase.co` URL. Optional but recommended once on Pro; lets us migrate
Supabase projects (region change, account swap) without invalidating every client's stored URL.

In the Supabase dashboard → Settings → Custom Domains:

1. Add `api.threkir.com`.
2. Supabase prints a CNAME target (`<ref>.supabase.co`) and a TXT verification record.
3. Add both to Cloudflare DNS (or whichever registrar you use). TTL 300.
4. Wait for verification (usually a few minutes; can take up to an hour).
5. Once verified, every client's `SUPABASE_URL` becomes `https://api.threkir.com` instead of `https://<ref>.supabase.co`.

Update the value in:
- Vercel env (`PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`)
- Mobile build configs (`apps/mobile_android/.env.production`, `apps/mobile_ios/dart_defines.json` for the production scheme)
- Wear OS Gradle property (`SUPABASE_URL` in `apps/watch_wear/android/.env.local` for prod builds — or pass via `-PSUPABASE_URL=...` in CI)

---

## CI deploy path

Triggered by tagging `backend@*`. The workflow at `.github/workflows/release-backend.yml`:

1. Checks out the tag.
2. Installs the Supabase CLI.
3. `supabase login --token $SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
4. `supabase link --project-ref $SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF`.
5. `supabase db push` — applies any unapplied migrations.
6. Loops over `supabase/functions/*/index.ts` and `supabase functions deploy` each.
7. Creates a GitHub Release pointing at the tag with the migration manifest as a release note.

Required GitHub Secrets (also listed in [releasing.md](../../docs/ops/releasing.md)):

| Secret | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Supabase dashboard → Account → Access Tokens (personal access token) |
| `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` | The `<ref>` from the project URL |
| `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` | Set during project creation; can be reset in the dashboard |

---

## Data layout in production

The schema is what local `supabase db reset` builds — see [api_database.md](../../docs/backend/api_database.md) for the table-by-table reference.

**Storage buckets** (configured by migration `20260405_001_initial_schema.sql` and the photos / route-files migrations that came after):

| Bucket | Public? | Path convention | RLS |
|---|---|---|---|
| `runs` | private | `{user_id}/{run_id}.json.gz`, `{user_id}/{run_id}.matched.json.gz` | owner-only via the `runs.user_id = auth.uid()` policy on the parent row |
| `route-files` | private | `{user_id}/{route_id}.gpx` etc. | owner-only |
| `run-photos` | private | `{user_id}/{run_id}/{photo_id}.jpg` | owner-only ([decisions.md § 36](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md#36-photos-on-runs-own-table--storage-bucket-visibility-tracks-the-parent-run)) |
| `avatars` | public | `{user_id}.{ext}` | anyone authenticated can SELECT, owner can write |

`/share/run/[id]` and `/share/route/[id]` rendering anonymous tracks works through the `clip_track_for_user` RPC ([decisions.md § 33](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md#33-privacy-zones-live-in-user_settings-clipping-is-client-side-nearby-leak-is-a-known-v1-gap)) — the bucket itself stays private, the RPC returns clipped points to anon callers.

---

## Observability

| Surface | Where | What |
|---|---|---|
| Postgres logs | Supabase dashboard → Logs → Postgres | slow queries, deadlocks, errors |
| EF logs | Supabase dashboard → Logs → Edge Functions | invocation count, runtime, console output |
| Auth events | Supabase dashboard → Auth → Logs | sign-in success/failure, JWT issues |
| Realtime | Supabase dashboard → Realtime → Channels | active subscribers, message rate |
| Custom queries | `select * from postgres_log;` from the SQL editor | one-off forensics |

**External uptime probe** (Better Stack or UptimeRobot): hit `https://<ref>.supabase.co/rest/v1/runs?select=count&limit=0` (or `api.threkir.com` once the Pro custom domain exists). It's a cheap PostgREST call that returns 200 only if Postgres is up + PostgREST is up + RLS still permits the anon role to read the table count. Set the alarm threshold at 2 consecutive failures (60 s gap).

**Sentry on the EF side:** every EF wraps its `serve` handler in `withSentry('<ef-name>', ...)` from `functions/_shared/sentry.ts`. Unhandled errors are captured with the EF name as a tag, then a 500 is returned so the caller still gets a clean response. Init is gated on `SENTRY_DSN` — set it via `supabase secrets set SENTRY_DSN=... APP_RELEASE=<tag>` against the linked project; an unset DSN makes the wrapper a passthrough so local `supabase functions serve` doesn't need a Sentry account.

## Cost projection

| Component | Tier | Monthly |
|---|---|---|
| Pro plan | base | $25 |
| Compute add-on | none at launch | $0 |
| Storage past 8 GB | $0.021/GB above 8 GB | $0 → modest |
| Egress past 250 GB | $0.09/GB | $0 → modest |
| Daily PITR backup | included | $0 |
| Custom domain | included on Pro | $0 |
| **Subtotal** | | **$25** |

Scaling drivers:

- 10k active users × 200 runs/year × 10 KB tracks ≈ 20 GB Storage → ~$0.25 above included
- Heavy bulk-import users (Strava 5-year backfills, ~30 MB per user) drive Storage faster than recording does
- Coach + dashboard activity drives egress; expect Vercel's Pro bandwidth to tip first

## Disaster recovery

### Quarterly drill (mandatory)

Without exercising it, the backup is a fiction. Run this once per quarter, document the timing in a top-comment on this file:

```bash
# 1. Create a fresh staging project at supabase.com (free tier is fine).
# 2. From a local clone of threkir:
cd apps/backend
supabase link --project-ref <staging-ref>

# 3. From the production project's dashboard, download the latest daily backup
#    (Settings → Database → Backups → Download).
# 4. Restore into the staging project.
supabase db reset --linked         # wipe the staging instance
psql "<staging-connection-string>" < backup.sql

# 5. Point a local web build at the staging URL + anon key.
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<staging-ref>.supabase.co \
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<staging-anon-key> \
  npm run dev --workspace=apps/web

# 6. Sign in as a known seed user; verify dashboard / runs list / run detail render.
# 7. Tear down the staging project. Record the timing in this file.
```

Target metrics: end-to-end restore in <30 min, smoke test in <10 min.

### Real-incident playbook

If production Postgres is corrupt / lost / wedged:

1. **Don't push schema changes** — they would propagate to the rebuilt instance.
2. Open the dashboard → Settings → Database → Backups. Pick the most recent good backup.
3. **Point In Time Recovery** lets you restore to any minute in the last 7 days. Use it if the corruption has a known timestamp; use the daily backup otherwise.
4. The restore goes to a new project (Supabase doesn't restore-in-place). The new project gets a new `<ref>`.
5. Repoint clients at the new project. With the Pro custom domain this is one CNAME update
   (5 min DNS propagation). **On the current Free tier there is no CNAME** — the new `<ref>`
   means updating `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` + `MOBILE_SUPABASE_URL` (+ the watch Gradle property),
   redeploying web, and shipping new mobile builds through the stores. This is the main
   operational argument for buying the custom domain when upgrading to Pro.
6. Edge Functions don't migrate automatically — re-run `supabase functions deploy` for each.
7. Once the new project has been smoke-tested, archive the old one (don't delete for 7 days in case you need to grab additional data).

**RTO ≤ 30 min** once DNS is the only client-side knob (Pro custom domain); on Free, web
recovers in ~30 min (secret update + redeploy) but mobile clients wait on a store release.
**RPO ≤ 5 min** with PITR; **≤ 24 h** with Pro daily backups; **unbounded on Free** (no
automated backups — take periodic manual `pg_dump`s until the Pro upgrade).

### Storage recovery

Storage objects don't share Postgres's PITR. Two protections:

1. **Bucket versioning.** Enable on the `runs` bucket (`Settings → Storage → Buckets → runs → Object Versions: ON`). Costs ~10% extra storage but makes accidental deletion recoverable for 30 days. Don't enable on `run-photos` — image versioning would balloon the bill.
2. **External cold copy.** A weekly `rclone` sync of the `runs` bucket to S3 / Backblaze B2 covers the case where the entire Supabase project is lost. Cron on the Fly.io worker — see [`apps/job_worker/deployment.md`](../../apps/job_worker/deployment.md) § Cold-storage backup (proposed).

---

## Rollback

Migrations are one-way. We never "roll back" a migration — write a compensating forward migration.

EFs roll back by re-deploying the previous tag's code:

```bash
git checkout backend@1.2.2
cd apps/backend
supabase functions deploy <fn> --project-ref <ref>
git checkout main
```

If a `backend@1.2.3` deploy broke a function, tag `backend@1.2.4` from a revert commit and let the workflow handle it. Avoid the hand-rolled flow above unless the workflow itself is what broke.

## Production readiness checklist

Before flipping the row in [`docs/ops/deployment.md`](../../docs/ops/deployment.md) from "Plan" to "Live":

- [ ] Tier decision recorded — Free today; upgrade to Pro (+ billing alert) before real users exist
- [ ] `eu-west-2` region (or whichever was picked) confirmed
- [ ] `supabase db push` ran clean against the live project
- [ ] All seven Edge Functions deployed; each logs a successful test invocation
- [ ] EF secrets set (`PARKRUN_USER_AGENT`, Strava env, RevenueCat env)
- [ ] Custom domain `api.threkir.com` verified (Pro + add-on only — skipped on Free; clients use the raw project URL)
- [ ] `pg_cron` schedules confirmed (`SELECT * FROM cron.job;` from SQL editor)
- [ ] Storage versioning on for `runs`
- [ ] External uptime probe live
- [ ] Backup drill performed at least once
- [x] Sentry project + DSN wired into the EF base — every EF wraps `serve` in `withSentry('<ef-name>', ...)` from `functions/_shared/sentry.ts`; `SENTRY_DSN` + `APP_RELEASE` set via `supabase secrets set`. Unset DSN keeps the wrapper a passthrough.
- [ ] `parity.md` rows marked ✓ for the EF-driven features
