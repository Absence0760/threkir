"""Boot the custom_watch firmware under Renode and assert on observable output.

The manual `bin/watch-sim.sh` session is the reference harness; this driver
wraps it so a CI runner can prove the sim still works end to end instead of
waiting for someone to run it by hand. It reuses the launcher rather than
re-implementing the boot sequence, so a regression in watch-sim.sh itself
(pty, defmt drain, monitor port, cleanup) also fails here.

Nine scenarios, selected with `--scenario` (default `all`). The five below are
the ones whose framing does not fit on a function docstring; `screens`, `idle`,
`workout` and `storm` each carry theirs on their own `scenario_*`.

`smoke` — the end-to-end pass. In order, each assertion grounded in the manual
evidence under sim/verification-2026-07-19/, except the two marked below:

  1. the flash run store arms at boot            run_flash: run store armed
  2. the canned NMEA parses into an accepted fix gps: fix ... sats=N (N>=4)
  3. the optical-HR driver reads the AFE model   hr: bpm N          (new)
  4. that fix starts a recording                 record: sim-autostart
  5. distance accumulates past a floor           record: recording dist=<m>
  6. the same fix reaches the PHONE link         tcp status frames  (new)
  7. the run face actually renders on the panel  DumpFrame -> non-blank PPM
  8. two BTN2 presses stop the run and commit    run_flash: stored run
  9. nothing panicked along the way

(3) and (6) are folded in here rather than given scenarios of their own because
neither needs anything this boot is not already doing, and a scenario costs a
whole emulator. Both cover a rail that had no assertion at all:

  - An AFE model has existed since 2026-07-19 and was built to take the
    optical-HR path off the bench gate, but no scenario ever read a BPM off it.
    The model is a MAX30101 since decisions.md § 623 — a positional FIFO, so
    this assertion now also covers the driver's slot tagging: a phase slip
    feeds ambient counts to the detector as PPG and no plausible BPM survives.
    The whole chain — TWIM EasyDMA master, the model's tagged MEAS1/MEAS2 sample
    stream, the driver's AGC and pulse detector — could break and every scenario
    would still pass.
  - The phone link is the sim's SECOND rail and the one the mobile app consumes
    (`emulation CreateServerSocketTerminal` in watch.resc -> the dev-only Sim
    watch link screen). Nothing here had ever opened that socket, so the panel
    could be perfect while the link emitted nothing, and the only way to find out
    was for a human to run the mobile screen against it.

`alerts` — the on-run alert engine reaches the panel. The sim arms its own
shortened cadences under `sim-autostart` (drink 30 s / eat 45 s of moving time,
a 100 m distance arm, a 60 s elapsed arm, and a 5:00-5:20/km band the ~5:33/km
bench_jog fixture sits outside), so this asserts what that arming makes
inevitable and nothing more — see `scenario_alerts`. The only scenario that
boots the `alerts` rail: every other one sheds it, per `SCENARIO_ARMED_RAILS`.

`pages` — the paged glance cycle. Walks the cycle right with `runMacro $btn4`
(§350: the lower-right key pages right) and, for each page of interest, waits
for the ui task's own page line and then dumps the panel. Two firmware lines are
read per press and they are different claims: the ui task's `ui: page <Name>` is
what the panel COMPOSED, the button task's `button: BTN4 -> page <Name>` is what
the press INTENDED, and each press asserts they agree — disagreement means the
cycle advanced without the panel following. The ui line is change-gated, so its
first occurrence is a boot-time anchor for `Page::default()`, which the walk
asserts and then uses to recognise a full lap. `$btn3` (the lower-left key) taps
back a page and is asserted to be the exact inverse of the forward walk;
`$btn3h`/`$btn4h` (hold) open the page-grid overview and are not exercised here.

`terrain` — the two pages the flat fixture cannot arm. Runs on mountain_loop
with the BMP581 model's triangle profile started, marks a waypoint with the
BTN5 hold (`$btn5h`, §357), waits for the baro's cumulative gain to pass the
20 m a climb opens at (§359), then walks the cycle and asserts BOTH pages are
now in it and render. `pages` proves these two stay OUT of an unarmed cycle;
this proves they come INTO an armed one, which is the half a mis-wired
data-presence bit would pass silently. Note the baro profile is load-bearing:
`feed_gap` prefers baro altitude over the fix's, so the fixture's GPS ramp
alone is shadowed by the model's static default.

`dropout` — the recorder across a signal void, on the gps_dropout fixture. The
one scenario here whose subject is a bug that has actually happened: the fixture
was written for the 2026-07-19 manual pass and caught the un-ported
`run_recorder` #330 gap re-anchor, which froze distance for the REST of a run
after any 1 Hz dropout that displaced the runner past `MAX_JUMP_M`. It was fixed
that day and has been guarded by two host tests and nothing else since — the
fixture itself stayed manual, so the end-to-end path that surfaced it had no
regression guard at all. This is that guard. See `scenario_dropout`.

**What a panel dump does NOT prove.** A dump shows that *something* was drawn,
not *what*: nothing here reads a glyph. The only evidence that a given page is
on screen is the firmware's own `ui: page <Name>` line, and the only evidence a
banner is up is its `ui: banner <Kind>` counterpart plus the ink a solid
inverse-video band has to add. Both are emitted AFTER `display.flush` returns,
which is what makes them evidence about the panel rather than about a task's
intent — the RECORD task's `record: alert <Kind>` is emitted before the alert
even reaches the composer and is never what a dump is taken against
(decisions.md § 716). Every assertion message says which of the two it rests
on. Comparing
two dumps is likewise weaker than it looks — the run's clock advances every
second, so any two frames taken seconds apart differ; what the comparison rules
out is a DumpFrame that never landed and left us re-reading a stale file.

What no scenario can cover, per decisions.md §314: BLE (the S140 SoftDevice does
not run under Renode), power draw, and any claim about real silicon — the sensor
models answer what the drivers believe about the parts.

Sessions: one boot per scenario, which is what CI has always done (one step
each) and what `--scenario all` now does too. `alerts` and `pages` shared a boot
until 2026-07-29 on the grounds that neither disturbed the other; `alerts` in
fact consumed the quiet window `pages` needs, because past ~100 s the sim's
overlapping alert cadences never let a banner expire with nothing behind it and
`record: alert cleared` stopped firing — see `plan_sessions`. The engine now
guarantees that gap (`watch_core::alerts::ALERT_QUIET_S`, decisions.md § 465)
and each scenario boots only the rails it asserts on (`SCENARIO_ARMED_RAILS`),
so a quiet window is a recurring resource rather than something one scenario
can spend on another's behalf; the boots stay separate all the same, because a
rail set is a property of the BUILD. Each session gets its own phone port
(`--phone-port` + session index) because watch.resc binds
that port at a FIXED number and watch-sim.sh aborts if it is still held — a
sequential re-launch must not race the previous Renode's teardown. `--budget` is
a cap on the WHOLE process, shared across sessions, so a per-scenario invocation
gets all of it and `--scenario all` splits it across every boot.

Determinism: the altitude and NMEA sources are virtual-time driven with no
randomness, so a given firmware + fixture replays identically. Every wait here
is on a specific decoded log line with a deadline, never a fixed sleep — the
exceptions are the two-press guards, which must land inside the firmware's 4 s
confirm window and so cannot wait on the "armed" line (a block-buffered decoder
could delay observing it past the window): the ~1.5 s gap between the two BTN2
presses (`smoke` and `workout` both stop a run), and the same gap between the
two BTN1 presses of `idle`'s factory erase, whose guard is that same window.
Each is delivered as a retried PAIR rather than a single press pair, because a
press that misses a poll is indistinguishable from one the guard rejected.

Usage:
  apps/custom_watch/sim/ci_smoke.py [--out-dir DIR] [--fixture NAME]
                                    [--phone-port N] [--budget SECONDS]
                                    [--scenario NAME]   (see SCENARIO_ORDER)

Requires: renode + defmt-print on PATH, and the sim-feature ELF already built
(the launcher builds it if not, but pre-building it in a separate step keeps a
compile failure distinguishable from a sim failure). `DEFMT_LOG=debug` is set
for the build the launcher does — the distance, fix and page assertions all
read debug-level lines, and defmt filters at compile time.

    `pages` walks the cycle on bench_jog, where Waypoint and Climb are
    LEGITIMATELY absent — nothing marks a point and the ground is flat — so
    until now both were verified only negatively: the harness proved they stay
    out of an unarmed cycle, never that they come into an armed one. A page can
    fail that way silently (a data-presence bit wired to the wrong field reads
    exactly like "no data"), which is the gap this closes.

    Two arming steps, and neither is incidental:

    **The baro ramp.** `Recorder::feed_gap` takes `baro_alt_m.or(fix.alt_m)` —
    baro FIRST. The BMP581 model defaults to a static 1600 m, so mountain_loop's
    GGA altitude ramp is shadowed by a flat baro and the climb detector sees
    level ground however steep the fixture is. Starting the model's triangle
    profile is therefore load-bearing, not scene-setting: without it this
    scenario fails while the firmware is correct. The rates (400 mm/s up,
    600 mm/s down between 1600 m and 1800 m) are the ones BMP581.cs documents as
    tracking this fixture's GPS ramp, so baro and GPS co-vary through the
    elevation complementary filter instead of fighting it.

    **The BTN5 hold.** §357's mark is the only way a waypoint exists, and it is
    a gesture no other scenario makes — `$btn5h` was added for this.

    What this proves and what it does not: the pages enter `Snapshot::pages_mask`
    and render non-blank. As everywhere else here, nothing reads a glyph — the
    page identity is the firmware's own `ui: page <Name>` line, and the mark is
    the record task's `run_flash: persisted waypoints`. That the WPT page shows
    the RIGHT bearing, or the CLMB page the right metres-remaining, is a
    host-test claim (`core/src/climb.rs`, `core/src/record.rs`), not a sim one.

def scenario_dropout(sim):
    """Cross a GPS signal void and prove the recorder comes back from it.

    The gps_dropout fixture is three legs: 40 clean 1 Hz fixes, a 40 s void of
    fix-quality-0 GGA and void RMC, then 40 s of reacquire 122 m downrange of the
    last good fix. Those numbers are the point. 122 m clears
    `watch_core::record::MAX_JUMP_M`, so the reacquire fix fails the one-hop cap;
    the gap clears `GPS_REANCHOR_AFTER_S`, so it is a real signal gap rather than
    a corrupt teleport and the anchor must REBASE to it. Before that re-anchor was
    ported from `run_recorder` (its #330), the stale anchor only ever receded and
    distance was frozen for the rest of the run.

    That bug is why this scenario exists. It was found by running this exact
    fixture by hand on 2026-07-19, fixed the same day, and guarded since by two
    host tests over `Recorder` — never by anything that drives the whole path from
    NMEA bytes through the parser and the publish cadence into the recorder. The
    fixture stayed a manual poke. So the class of regression that would slip past
    the host tests — a parser that stops emitting through the void, a publish
    cadence that swallows the reacquire, a fix-quality gate that lets the void's
    empty GGA through as a fix at 0,0 — had no guard at all.

    Three claims, in the order the run produces them:

      1. the pre-void leg banks distance
      2. the void freezes it, and every sample inside the void reads `paused` —
         an auto-pause is the honest read of "no fixes", and a recorder that kept
         crediting distance through a void would be inventing it
      3. the reacquire moves it again

    (3) is the #330 guard. (2) is what makes (3) mean something: distance that
    never stopped growing would satisfy (3) trivially.

    **Why the void is measured and not assumed.** The void's length in the
    FIRMWARE's clock is not the fixture's 40 s — the NMEA feeder is wall-clock
    driven while the emulator's virtual clock drifts against the host's under
    load, the same skew `watch.resc` times its button holds around. A host slow
    enough to compress the void under `GPS_REANCHOR_AFTER_S` would leave the
    anchor legitimately held and distance legitimately frozen, and reporting that
    as a frozen recorder would be a lie. So the gap is read off the decoded
    stream's own timestamps and reported when it is too short.

    **The resume search stops where the fixture restarts.** `watch-sim.sh` loops
    the NMEA file, and the loop teleports the runner ~354 m back to its start —
    from where they walk toward the anchor a broken recorder is still holding,
    until the delta falls back under `MAX_JUMP_M` over a dt of minutes and
    credits ~98 m in one lump. Distance resumes, for entirely the wrong reason.
    The first version of this scenario passed against a firmware with the
    re-anchor disabled on exactly that. The restart is found in the published-fix
    stream itself (`fixture_restart_at`) rather than timed around, because
    Renode's virtual clock runs at a ratio to wall time that swings with host
    load and the loop is paced by the wall.

def scenario_idle(sim):
    """The idle surfaces: the settings menu (§351) and the faces BTN4 walks (§358).

    Boots `--no-autostart`, which is the point: every other scenario in this
    file starts a run on the first fix and pages the RUN view, so the idle
    surfaces — the settings menu here, the faces BTN4 walks — had no scenario
    at all. The `Sim` docstring says as much ("every scenario in this file skips
    past by design"); this is the one that does not.

    Three rails share one boot. The menu: BTN5 opens it and it reaches the
    panel, BTN3 walks all seven rows in their documented order and wraps, BTN2
    walks back, an edit on the GNSS row moves the ladder, BTN4 closes it. Then
    the three faces BTN4 walks — Home, Diagnostics, and the §358 ICE card a
    responder reads off a collapsed runner's wrist — each rendering a distinct
    frame, plus the menu's own MEDICAL ID row as the card's second route in.
    Then §378's factory erase, last because it resets the ladder the middle
    rail spent its presses walking.

    The erase's assertions are about the GUARD as much as the wipe. One press
    has to emit the ARM line and change the panel; stepping off the row and
    back has to leave the next press arming again rather than confirming; only
    then does the second adjacent press wipe. A row wired straight through
    would fail the first of those, and a guard that armed but never cancelled
    would fail the second — which is the whole safety claim, since neither is
    visible in a scenario that just presses twice and looks for the wipe.

    That the wipe DID something is read off the GNSS mode falling back to its
    factory rung — a setting this scenario itself walked to the far end of the
    ladder minutes earlier, so a reset can only be a leftward move and cannot
    be another edit press misread. It is the one erased thing the sim can
    observe from outside the firmware's own claim about itself.

    The edit is the claim with teeth. A menu that renders and scrolls but whose
    edits go nowhere passes every other assertion here, so the GNSS row is read
    back off the button task's own `gnss mode ->` line, including the
    direction: the ladder is ordered by projected battery hours, so an edit
    right must not come back with fewer. It is parked at its left end first, so
    the ordering has two samples to compare and does not depend on whatever
    mode the build defaults to.

    The faces are folded in here rather than given a scenario of their own
    because they need exactly this boot and nothing more, and a scenario costs
    an emulator — the same call § 362 made for the HR and phone-link rails.

    What it does NOT prove: that an edit SURVIVES A REBOOT. `CFG1` persistence
    is a flash claim and this scenario never power-cycles the emulator; the
    menu's own writes are best-effort / L4 by design (a flash error warns and
    the edit still applies), so a green run here says nothing about what comes
    back after a brown-out. Nor legibility — seven rows on a 168x144 1-bit
    panel read at 45 cm is a step-4 bench claim, per quality_standards.md.

    **And it proves nothing about bytes leaving flash — read the reported
    `flash cleared` narrowly.** Renode's flash is plain memory behind an
    SVD-derived NVMC model: `READY` answers 1, so the store arms itself at boot
    and the erase path runs to completion, but the `ERASEPAGE` write lands on an
    "unimplemented register" and is swallowed. The firmware therefore reports
    success over an emulator that changed nothing. What this scenario earns is
    the guard, the fan-out, the RAM half, and that the erase path executes and
    reports rather than silently no-opping. That four run slots and a config
    page actually read back 0xFF is a bench item (quality_standards.md step 7)
    — and it is the half that matters for a watch that has left its owner's
    hands.

    The last major run-view rail without a scenario. Everything about
    `watch_core::workout` up to here is host-tested against the mobile runner's
    own vectors, and the demo workout had been walked BY HAND in the sim — but
    nothing automated had ever driven a step list through the recorder, the
    alert engine and into flash on a booted emulator, so the whole seam between
    the ported state machine and the firmware around it was unguarded.

    Six claims, in the order the run produces them:

      1. the pushed step list ARMS the recorder (`state::WORKOUT`, the same
         channel the ble task's `WKT1` decode publishes on)
      2. the Workout page enters the cycle and renders
      3. the runner auto-advances through the plan IN ORDER, over both end axes
      4. the end-of-step warning fires on the one step long enough to earn it,
         and on no other
      5. a BTN5 lap press skips the active step (§354) and, on the last one,
         completes the workout
      6. the completed trail flushes into the run blob with nothing dropped

    (3) and (4) are the two with the most reach. The plan mixes distance steps
    (60 / 50 / 50 / 60 m) with a duration one (30 s recovery), so a runner that
    settles only one axis stalls partway and reports a SHORT sequence rather
    than a wrong one. And the ending window is gated — `ENDING_MIN_STEP_M` is
    100 m so none of the distance steps qualify, `ENDING_MIN_STEP_S` is 20 s so
    the recovery alone does — which makes "exactly one warning, inside the
    recovery" a claim about the gate itself. A runner that warned on every step
    passes a mere "a warning fired" check and fails this one.

    (5) is the button half, and it is asserted on the FIRMWARE's clock rather
    than on the harness's: see `assert_lap_skipped`.

    **What this does NOT prove.** Nothing here reads a glyph, so `NOT SYNCED`
    and `WORKOUT DONE` are not verified as TEXT — the page's presence in the
    cycle is `Snapshot::pages_mask`'s `workout.is_some()` bit and its content is
    a host-test claim (`core/src/face.rs`). Nor the real `WKT1` transport: the
    sim arms over the channel the ble task publishes on, but the GATT
    characteristic and its chunked reassembly need a SoftDevice, which Renode
    does not run (decisions §314). And not the negative half — every boot in
    this file that starts a run also arms the demo workout, so "the Workout page
    stays OUT of a cycle with no workout" has no session to be asserted in.

    """Drive a front past the barometer and prove the watch names it.

    The § 376 rail end to end: the BMP581 model's SEA-LEVEL reference is ramped
    down while its altitude stays put, which is a weather change and not a
    movement one — the station pressure falls, the GPS altitude the firmware
    reduces against does not, and the reduced pressure therefore falls with it.
    That is the signal the whole module exists to isolate.

    Four claims, in order, and each grounded in the baro task's own line rather
    than in a panel:

    1. **The tracker refuses before it can measure.** A window is three hours on
       hardware and 60 s under `--storm`; until a third of it is banked the
       answer is `Building`, not a tendency extrapolated from a minute of air.
    2. **A quiet atmosphere is quiet.** Before the ramp starts, the tendency
       reads `Steady` with a residual under `STORM_QUIET_HPA`. This is the
       assertion a false positive would fail, and it is worth more than the
       storm one: a watch that cries wolf on a calm day is worse than one with
       no storm page at all.
    3. **A scripted fall reaches `Storm`,** with a delta past the armed
       threshold and the right sign.
    4. **The banner fires exactly once,** which is a claim about the arm's
       once-per-front hysteresis and only holds because `--no-alerts` leaves it
       alone in the single banner slot.

    Then the page: it enters the BTN4 cycle (its presence bit is "a reduced
    pressure can be stated") and renders non-blank.

    **What this scenario deliberately does NOT prove.** The separation of a
    climb from a front — the module's entire reason for existing — cannot be
    scripted here: the firmware's altitude reference comes from the NMEA
    fixture, which the harness cannot ramp independently of the barometer, so a
    "climb" in-sim is a baro ramp against a flat GPS altitude, which IS weather
    as far as any correct implementation can tell. That separation is
    host-tested instead (`core/src/storm.rs`:
    `a_climb_at_constant_weather_is_not_a_storm` and
    `a_falling_front_while_climbing_still_reads_the_front`), and this scenario
    guards the rail those tests cannot reach: sensor to reduction to trend to
    alert slot to page.

    `alerts` and `pages` used to share a boot on the grounds that "both need a
    live recording and neither disturbs the other". The second half was wrong.
    `pages` refuses to dump under a banner (a dump taken under one is a dump OF
    the banner), so it waits for `record: alert cleared` — and the engine only
    emits that when a banner expires with nothing behind it. Past roughly 100 s
    the sim's shortened cadences overlap: drink at 30 s, eat at 45 s, and since
    § 354 a WorkoutStep alert on every rep boundary, each raised inside the
    previous one's 8 s TTL. The engine then goes banner-to-banner and `cleared`
    never fires, so `alerts` — which runs ~100 s — was handing `pages` a boot
    with no quiet window left in it. Sharing did not just cost time, it consumed
    the exact resource the other scenario needed.

    So each scenario now gets its own boot, which is also how CI has always run
    them (one step per scenario, one process each). `--scenario all` and the CI
    job finally agree about what is being executed.

    `smoke` and `workout` additionally have to be alone — each stops the run the
    others need in progress — `terrain` and `dropout` are each on a different
    fixture and a boot has exactly one, and every scenario boots only the rails
    it asserts on (`launcher_args`), which are a property of the BUILD a session
    boots and so cannot be shared either.

    Each session carries its scenario's own fixture. An explicit `--fixture`
    overrides every one of them, which is how a manual session points an
    existing scenario at new terrain.
