// The Art 20 export retention reaper (kind='export_blob_reap').
//
// `cleanup_stale_export_blobs()` deletes rows from `storage.objects`, and
// decisions § 1049 measured what that buys: the archive stops being listable
// and the bytes stay on the backend with a matching sha256. The SQL tier
// cannot buy more than that — a row delete is not an object delete, which is
// why storage-api ships a trigger refusing one. Only the Storage API erases,
// and the worker is the tier that already holds the service key and already
// writes these archives through it.
//
// The reaper derives its own worklist rather than being handed one. That is
// the ordering problem § 1049 named: once the row is gone nothing in the
// database knows the object exists, so a reaper fed by the SQL sweep must run
// inside the same transaction and BEFORE the delete, and one that runs after
// is reaping a list nobody can produce. Listing the bucket needs neither — the
// list API reads the same rows, so running the reap first makes the row delete
// redundant rather than load-bearing.
//
// What it does NOT recover: objects whose rows a previous sweep already
// deleted. Those are unreachable through the Storage API by construction
// (list reads `storage.objects`), and need a bucket lifecycle rule or direct
// backend access instead.
