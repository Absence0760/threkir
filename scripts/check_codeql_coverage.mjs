// Guardrail: the set of trees CodeQL BUILDS is the set of trees that exist.
//
// CodeQL analyses whatever the build steps compile, for every compiled
// language. So for `go` and `java-kotlin` the build step is not a performance
// detail — it IS the scope of the scan, and a module or Gradle project nobody
// builds is source nobody scans. Nothing about the resulting database says so:
// one holding a single module looks exactly like one holding every module, and
// the analysis reports clean either way. A scanner that reports success over a
// path it never read is worse than no scanner, because it is believed.
//
// This has now happened on both compiled legs. `apps/graph_cycle` went
// unscanned for the whole of its life while a comment above the build step
// called `apps/job_worker` "our only Go module" (decisions § 1304), and the
// explicit build was itself what suppressed the `runAutobuildIfLegacyGoWorkflow`
// net that would have caught it. The Kotlin leg then turned out to carry the
// same shape: one `working-directory: apps/watch_wear/android`, a header
// claiming both Kotlin surfaces, and 11 files under `apps/mobile_android/android`
// — `MainActivity.kt`, `RunActionReceiver.kt`, the platform-channel bridges —
// that the java-kotlin analysis had never read (decisions § 1352). There is no
// Java/Kotlin analogue of the Go autobuild net, and `build-mode: none` cannot
// stand in for one: CodeQL's buildless Java extractor does not process Kotlin.
//
// Both were fixed by enumerating the trees from the filesystem instead of
// naming them. This is what keeps that honest, and the anchor is deliberate:
// it does not look for the WORDS of an enumeration, it lifts the workflow's own
// `find` expression out of the step and RUNS it, then compares the answer with
// an independent walk of the tree. A step that goes back to a hardcoded path,
// drops a `-name` alternative, or grows a `-not -path` that hides a directory
// all diverge from the walk and fail here. A guard keyed on the spelling would
// pass every one of those; a guard keyed on the answer cannot. (Same instrument
// as `edge_functions_typecheck_coverage.test.mjs`, which lifts the deno-check
// lane's own file-list expression out of ci.yml and runs it.)
//
// The second half is the exclusion. A tree the job cannot build yet is DECLARED
// in a `<LANG>_UNBUILT` env value carrying its reason, and the step's own loop
// reads that same value to decide what to skip — so the declaration is wiring,
// not documentation, and deleting it makes the job attempt the build rather
// than quietly widen the gap. Here it is re-measured: an entry naming a
// directory the walk does not find has outlived what it excused and fails, and
// an exclusion list that has grown to cover every tree fails too, because an
// analysis over nothing is the state this whole guard exists to make visible.
//
// The third half is the INTERPRETED legs, which this guard used to say nothing
// about at all. `javascript-typescript` and `actions` run `build-mode: none`,
// so no build step can narrow them — that is true of the BUILD and it was read
// as if it were true of the SCAN. It is not: an `init` step's `config` takes
// `paths` / `paths-ignore`, and the `actions` leg already carries a
// `query-filters` block dropping one rule by id. Either narrows the analysis
// exactly as the Kotlin `working-directory` did, and nothing read either, so a
// `paths-ignore` on the JS leg would have removed apps/web from the scan with
// no more signal than a green check. A coverage guard silent about half its
// subject reports more assurance than it has, which is the same defect one
// level up from the one it was written for.
//
// The fourth half is what an interpreted leg CANNOT declare. `queries:` names a
// suite CodeQL resolves at run time, and for a language shipping no such suite
// it falls back without saying so — `actions` has a `security-extended`
// ceiling, so the workflow asks for `security-and-quality` and gets something
// else. No guard in `workflow-lint` can close that: the answer exists only once
// a scan has run, and this job has neither CodeQL nor a network. What it can
// refuse is a job that stopped looking, so a leg flagged `suiteMayDowngrade`
// must keep its analyze SARIF on disk and read it back in the same job — the
// measurement is the job's to write, its existence is this guard's to hold
// (decisions § 1503).
//
// So every narrowing an interpreted leg DECLARES is read here and must earn
// itself: a reason in the comment lines directly above it (a scan hole costs at
// least MIN_REASON_CHARS of prose), and a target that still names something
// real — a path glob matching nothing in this tree has outlived whatever it
// excused, and a `query-filters` id whose language prefix this leg cannot
// produce filters nothing. `queries:` is read the same way, because selecting a
// suite narrower than the broadest available is narrowing the scan by another
// route. A `config-file:` is refused outright rather than followed: narrowing
// this guard cannot see is the state it exists to prevent.
//
// Run: `node scripts/check_codeql_coverage.mjs`
// CI:  the `workflow-lint` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml, which is in the
//      `CI gate` aggregator's `needs:` list.
// Unit tests: `node --test scripts/check_codeql_coverage.test.mjs`
