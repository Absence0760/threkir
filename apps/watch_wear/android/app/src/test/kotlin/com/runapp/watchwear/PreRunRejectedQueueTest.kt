/// Source-level guard over the PreRun chip that reports the queue entries the
/// server has permanently refused, and over the discard behind it
/// (decisions § 1347).
///
/// The two halves it pins are the two halves of the defect. A permanently
/// rejected run stays queued by design, so without a surface the runner sees a
/// count that never falls and a Sync that reports success on every tap; and the
/// only remedy is destructive, so the surface must not fire on one press and
/// must not act on the queue at large — a run saved since the last drain pass
/// has never been tried, and taking it with the stuck ones would destroy a run
/// nobody judged.
///
/// Compose wiring is not host-JVM testable without Robolectric, which this
/// module avoids, so this is a source grep per the module's convention
/// (`PostRunDiscardConfirmTest`, `ScreenWiringTest`). The behaviour underneath
/// — which ids a pass rejects and which survive to the next one — is real unit
/// coverage in `DrainQueueLoopTest`; this file pins only the wiring those
/// values reach the wrist through.
