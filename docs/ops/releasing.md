# Releasing

Per-app release workflows, **triggered by publishing a GitHub Release**
(not a bare tag push). Each app ships on its own cadence — publishing a
`mobile_android@1.2.3` Release cuts an Android release and does not touch
web, backend, or any of the watches. The published Release is the deploy
gate: no Release object, no deploy (added 2026-07-11 — every
`release-*.yml` moved from `on: push: tags` to `on: release: [published]`).

This file covers the **release → CI workflow** mechanics. For where each
service runs in production (provider, region, sizing, secrets,
observability, rollback, DR) see the per-service deployment plans:

- [`docs/ops/deployment.md`](deployment.md) — cross-service hub
- [`apps/backend/deployment.md`](../../apps/backend/deployment.md)
- [`apps/web/deployment.md`](../../apps/web/deployment.md)
- [`apps/job_worker/deployment.md`](../../apps/job_worker/deployment.md) (worker + OSRM)
- [`apps/mobile_android/deployment.md`](../../apps/mobile_android/deployment.md)
- [`apps/mobile_ios/deployment.md`](../../apps/mobile_ios/deployment.md) (covers Apple Watch bundling)
- [`apps/watch_wear/deployment.md`](../../apps/watch_wear/deployment.md)

**CI-only.** Release builds happen on GitHub Actions runners, never on a
laptop. Signing keys live in GitHub Secrets; no developer ever holds a
copy. A release APK built with `flutter build apk` on your machine will
not install as an update over the Play Store build because the keys
don't match — use `flutter run` for local testing.

## Tag conventions

The tag naming is unchanged — `gh release create` creates the tag as it
publishes the Release, so the same `<app>@<version>` names route to the
same workflows. What changed is the *trigger*: the Release, not the tag
push, is what fires the deploy.

```
mobile_android@1.2.3   → .github/workflows/release-android.yml
mobile_ios@1.2.3       → .github/workflows/release-ios.yml
watch_wear@1.2.3       → .github/workflows/release-watch-wear.yml
watch_ios@1.2.3        → .github/workflows/release-watch.yml
web@1.2.3              → .github/workflows/release-web.yml
backend@1.2.3          → .github/workflows/release-backend.yml
worker@1.2.3           → .github/workflows/release-worker.yml
osrm@1.2.3             → .github/workflows/release-osrm.yml
graph-cycle@1.2.3      → .github/workflows/release-graph-cycle.yml
graphhopper@1.2.3      → .github/workflows/release-graphhopper.yml
```

The glob is `<app>@*`, so any suffix works — `1.2.3`, `1.2.3-rc.1`,
`2.0.0-beta.4`. The workflow parses the suffix as the `versionName` and
derives a monotonic `versionCode` from `git rev-list --count HEAD`.

**Apple Watch ships inside the iOS app.** Publishing a `watch_ios@*`
Release runs a build smoke-check only (no artifact, nothing written back
to the Release); the canonical user-facing release is `mobile_ios@*`,
which bundles the watchOS target.

That bundling is real as of 2026-09-18 and was not before —
`Runner.xcodeproj` referenced nothing under `apps/watch_ios/` until
[decisions § 1656](../architecture/decisions.md) added a `WatchApp`
target and an Embed Watch Content phase. **Verified on this Mac** (Xcode
26.4): `flutter build ios --release --no-codesign` puts
`Runner.app/Watch/WatchApp.app` in place with `CFBundleDisplayName =
Threkir`, `WKCompanionAppBundleIdentifier = com.threkir.app`, all seven
`.lproj` compiled, and the same `0.1.0` version on both bundles — that
last one matters, because Apple rejects an upload whose watch app and
companion disagree. **Not verified, and device-gated:** a signed
`flutter build ipa` (no distribution certificate on this workstation) and
one run syncing end to end from a paired physical watch, which is § 1256
step 5 and the one checkbox nobody has been able to tick.

## Cutting a release

```bash
# Make sure main is green, then publish a GitHub Release. `gh release
# create` creates the tag AND the Release in one step; publishing it is
# what triggers the deploy. Don't edit pubspec.yaml / build.gradle.kts
# manually — the workflow reads the version from the tag name.
git checkout main && git pull
gh release create mobile_android@1.2.3 --title "Android 1.2.3" --generate-notes
```

You can also publish from the **Releases → Draft a new release** UI (pick
or type the `<app>@<version>` tag, write notes, **Publish**), or via the
`/release` skill. A plain `git push origin <tag>` does **nothing** now —
the workflow only fires on `release: [published]`.

`on: release` fires for every published Release in the repo, so each
`release-*.yml` job is guarded to its own `<app>@` tag prefix; publishing
a `web@*` Release runs only `release-web` (the other eight jobs evaluate
their `if:` to false and are skipped). The artifact-building workflows
(android, iOS, Wear, web) then attach their build output **back onto that
same Release** for rollback; the deploy-only workflows (backend, worker,
osrm, graph-cycle) don't write anything back — the Release is purely
their trigger.

**Every prod release job pauses for approval first** (added 2026-07-11):
the deploy jobs declare the `production` GitHub environment, whose
required-reviewer rule (repo Settings → Environments) holds the run at
"Waiting for review" until an approver clicks **Approve and deploy** in
the run's page. So a prod deploy now needs **two** deliberate acts — a
published Release *and* an environment approval. `release-web`'s preview
leg resolves to the ungated `preview` environment instead, so continuous
preview deploys stay approval-free. A run nobody approves within GitHub's
30-day wait window just expires — re-run the workflow to try again.

### What gets published where

The "Release" that triggers each row is published by a human (`gh release
create` / UI / `/release`). The last column is what the workflow attaches
**back** onto that Release afterward.

| Release tag | Runs | Signs | Publishes to | Attaches back to the Release |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mobile_android@*` | ubuntu-latest | release keystore from secrets | Play Internal track | `.aab` |
| `watch_wear@*` | ubuntu-latest | Wear release keystore | Play Internal track (`com.threkir.watchwear`) | `.aab` |
| `mobile_ios@*` | macos-latest | *unsigned today* (skeleton until app ships) | — | `.ipa` |
| `watch_ios@*` | macos-latest | — | — (build smoke-check only) | — |
| `web@*` | ubuntu-latest | — | AWS S3 + CloudFront + Lambda (`prod` env at `threkir.com` / `www.threkir.com`) | build zip |
| `backend@*` | ubuntu-latest | — | Supabase (migrations + functions on linked project) | — |
| `worker@*` | ubuntu-latest | — | Fly.io `job_worker` app via `flyctl deploy --remote-only` | — |
| `osrm@*` | ubuntu-latest | — | Fly.io `osrm` app (image only — graph on the volume rides along) | — |
| `graph-cycle@*` | ubuntu-latest | — | Fly.io `graph-cycle` app (image only — OSM PBF stays on the `graph_cycle_data` volume; reparsed on boot) | — |
| `graphhopper@*` | ubuntu-latest | — | Fly.io `graphhopper` app (image only — the PBF + built `graph-cache/` stay on the `graphhopper_data` volume) | — |

Promoting Android + Wear from the Internal track to Beta or Production
is done manually in the Play Console after you've smoke-tested the
Internal build. The workflow deliberately stops at Internal so a tag
doesn't immediately reach users.

## Required GitHub Secrets

Configure at **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.

### Android

| Secret | What |
|---|---|
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | `base64 -i upload-keystore.jks` output |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | store password |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | alias inside the keystore |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | key password (often same as store) |
| `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | Google Play service-account JSON key |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Sentry mobile project DSN. Passed as `--dart-define=SENTRY_DSN=...` at build time; empty disables (`sentry_flutter` init in `lib/main.dart` is gated). |
| `APP_RELEASE` | `mobile_android@<version>` tag — passed as `--dart-define=APP_RELEASE=...` so Sentry events are tagged with the release. Defaults to `dev` when unset. |

Creating the keystore (one-time):
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore upload-keystore.jks -alias upload \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
base64 -i upload-keystore.jks -o upload-keystore.jks.b64
# Paste the b64 contents into the secret.
```

Creating the Play service account (one-time): Play Console → Users and
permissions → Invite new users → "API access" → create a service
account in Google Cloud → download the JSON key → paste into
`PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`. Grant "Release manager" on the app.

### Wear OS

Same shape as Android, different keystore (the Wear app has its own
`applicationId`, `com.threkir.watchwear`, so it needs its own upload
identity):

| Secret | What |
|---|---|
| `WATCH_WEAR_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | base64-encoded Wear keystore |
| `WATCH_WEAR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | |
| `WATCH_WEAR_KEY_ALIAS` | |
| `WATCH_WEAR_KEY_PASSWORD` | |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | production Supabase URL (injected at build time) |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | production anon key |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Sentry watch_wear project DSN. Read via `BuildConfig.SENTRY_DSN` from `.env.local` at Gradle-configure time; CI sets it from this secret. Empty disables. |
| `APP_RELEASE` | `watch_wear@<version>` tag for Sentry release tagging. Defaults to `dev`. |

`PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` can be shared with the Android release if
the service account has Release-manager on both apps.

### iOS (when ready to flip on signing)

| Secret | What |
|---|---|
| `IOS_BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` | Apple distribution `.p12` |
| `IOS_P12_PASSWORD` | `.p12` password |
| `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` | App Store provisioning profile |
| `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` | throwaway — gate for the ephemeral keychain on the runner |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID` | |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_ISSUER_ID` | |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_BASE64` | `.p8` from App Store Connect |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Sentry mobile project DSN — same DSN as Android (Sentry tags by platform automatically). Passed as `--dart-define=SENTRY_DSN=...`. |
| `APP_RELEASE` | `mobile_ios@<version>` tag for Sentry release tagging. Defaults to `dev`. |

These blocks are commented out in `release-ios.yml` today — uncomment
when the Flutter iOS app is feature-complete (see `apps/mobile_ios/CLAUDE.md`).
The watch_ios target reads `SENTRY_DSN` + `APP_RELEASE` from the
build's Info.plist (set via Xcode build settings or a `xcrun
agvtool`-style script step in CI); the Sentry SwiftPM package needs
to be added to the watchOS target before the init in `RunApp.init()`
activates (gated on `canImport(Sentry)`).

### Web (AWS deploy)

The web workflow assumes an IAM role via GitHub OIDC — there is **no** `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` long-lived secret. The role ARN points at the deploy role provisioned by the Terraform `github-oidc` stack (see [`apps/web/deployment.md`](../../apps/web/deployment.md)). Build-time `PUBLIC_*` env vars are written into `apps/web/.env.production` before `npm run build` and inlined into the static bundle.

| Secret | What |
|---|---|
| `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN_PROD` | IAM role ARN assumed via OIDC for prod deploys (tag `web@*`). Trust policy scoped to `repo:<owner>/<repo>:ref:refs/tags/web@*`. |
| `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN_PREVIEW` | Same shape for the preview env (push to `main`). Trust policy scoped to `:ref:refs/heads/main`. |
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Production Supabase REST URL — the raw `https://<ref>.supabase.co` (`api.threkir.com` is a Pro-only custom domain, not provisioned on the current Free tier). Inlined into the build. |
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase **publishable** key. Inlined into the build. |
| `PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY` | MapTiler key shared with mobile + Wear OS. Inlined into the build. |
| `PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_WEB_CHECKOUT_URL` | RevenueCat hosted Web Paywall Link (`https://pay.rev.cat/<token>`). Inlined into the build; the prod-env guard fails the release if unset. |
| `PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_WEB_PORTAL_URL` | RevenueCat no-code customer-portal link. Optional — empty degrades the manage-subscription button to a hint. |
| `PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | Frontend Sentry DSN. Optional — empty disables client-side capture. |
| `APP_RELEASE` | `web@<version>` tag — passed as `PUBLIC_APP_RELEASE` for Sentry release tagging. Defaults to `dev`. |

Server-only secrets (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, server-side `SENTRY_DSN`) live **sops-encrypted in the PRIVATE estate repo** at `../infra-secrets/threkir/<env>.sops.yaml` (never in this public repo — see the secrets row in the root CLAUDE.md), with one AWS KMS key per env decrypting them. Terraform reads them at apply time (via the `carlpett/sops` provider) and writes them into the Lambda's `environment.variables` block. The Lambda gets them as plain env vars at runtime — no AWS SDK calls, no cold-start secret-fetch latency. Rotation is `sops <file>` → save → `terraform apply` (or `bin/secret-set.sh <env> <KEY> < value-file` for non-interactive single-key rotation, then `terraform apply`). No secret values touch GitHub Secrets.

For the AWS-side deploy + rotation flows (preflight, orchestrated apply, sops bootstrap, post-deploy health check, interactive disaster recovery) see [`bin/README.md`](../../bin/README.md).

### Backend

| Secret | What |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | CLI personal access token |
| `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` | target project's ref (e.g. `abcd1234xyz`) |
| `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` | Postgres password for `supabase db push` |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Sentry backend project DSN. Set via `supabase secrets set` against the linked project; the EFs' `_shared/sentry.ts` no-ops when unset. |
| `APP_RELEASE` | `backend@<version>` tag for Sentry release tagging. Set alongside `SENTRY_DSN` via `supabase secrets set`. |

### Worker + OSRM + graph_cycle (Fly.io)

| Secret | What |
|---|---|
| `FLY_API_TOKEN` | Fly.io API token scoped to the `project-running` org. The org keeps that name: Fly org slugs are embedded in billing and token scoping, so they are painful to change (see `apps/job_worker/deployment.md`). It no longer matches the AWS account, which is `Threkir` as of 2026-09-14 — account `374902171933`, previously carrying the auto-generated name `Unabashed6416` rather than the `project-running` this line used to claim. Same token covers the `worker@*`, `osrm@*`, `graph-cycle@*`, and `graphhopper@*` workflows. |

## Rollback

- **Android / Wear OS:** the Play Console has a "Halt rollout" button on
  any release. Use it, then push a fresh patch tag (`mobile_android@1.2.4`)
  with the fix — you can't re-use a `versionCode`, so rolling back is
  always a roll-forward with higher numbers.
- **Web:** two paths depending on which half is broken. Static-site
  rollback: download the previous tag's `web-build-<version>.zip` from
  its GitHub Release, unzip, and `aws s3 sync ./build/ s3://<bucket>/
  --delete` against the prod bucket, then `aws cloudfront create-
  invalidation --distribution-id <id> --paths "/*"`. Coach Lambda
  rollback: every `lambda update-function-code` produces a numbered
  version, and Terraform creates a `live` alias — `aws lambda update-
  alias --function-name web-coach-prod --name live --function-version
  <previous>` retargets traffic in seconds. Full procedure in
  [`apps/web/deployment.md` § Rollback](../../apps/web/deployment.md#rollback).
- **Backend:** Edge Functions can be rolled back by re-deploying the
  previous tag's function code (`supabase functions deploy <name>
  --project-ref ... --tag <ref>` — or just push a new tag with the old
  code reverted). Migrations are one-way — don't try to "roll back" a
  migration; write a compensating forward migration.

## Local dev path (explicitly NOT release)

Everything below produces unsigned or debug-signed artifacts that
cannot be promoted to users. If a laptop gets a release keystore, the
whole "keys stay in one place" story breaks.

```bash
# Mobile Android — debug-signed, installs as an update to existing debug.
flutter run -d <device>

# Wear OS — debug-signed, installs to an emulator or connected watch.
cd apps/watch_wear/android && ./gradlew installDebug

# Web — served at :7777 for dev, :8888 for preview build.
npm run dev --workspace=apps/web

# Backend — runs entirely against the local Supabase stack.
cd apps/backend && supabase start
```

If you catch yourself running `flutter build apk` + `adb install`
against a physical device you use normally, stop. The release APK is
signed with a key your laptop doesn't have; it'll install as a *second*
app alongside the Play Store one and won't sync the same installation.
Use `flutter run` (or `./gradlew installDebug` for Wear) for testing.

Every release workflow attaches an `.aab` and never a `.apk` — a bundle
isn't directly installable, so there is nothing on a GitHub Release to
`adb install`. That's deliberate: see the registration gate below. To
test the exact signed build that shipped, join the Play Internal track
and install from there.

## Before cutting a release

- `main` is green in CI.
- The app compiles locally — don't rely on CI to catch build breakage.
- Schema changes: if you deployed `backend@X`, apps that depend on the
  new schema should tag after (or at least not ahead of) `backend@X`.
- **Health Connect permission changes block the Android release.** If the
  diff since the last `mobile_android@*` tag adds or removes an
  `android.permission.health.*` entry in `AndroidManifest.xml` /
  `res/xml/health_permissions.xml`, update the Play Console **Health apps
  declaration** to cover the new data-type set *before* tagging. The
  declaration is per-package and version-independent, so an unchanged
  permission set needs nothing — but a changed one fails the release at
  the very last step. Details + the API-vs-Console trap in
  [`apps/mobile_android/deployment.md` § Health Connect permission
  changes](../../apps/mobile_android/deployment.md#health-connect-permission-changes-gate-the-release).
- **Android developer verification — gates any non-Play distribution.**
  From **2026-09-30** (Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand first;
  global through 2027) an Android app must be registered by a verified
  developer to install on certified devices. Distributing through Play
  registers a package automatically: `com.threkir.app` has been
  registered since 2026-07-14, and `com.threkir.watchwear` registers
  itself the first time a `watch_wear@*` release reaches the Internal
  track — no manual step, and nothing to do before that first Wear
  release. The gate is the other direction: **do not attach an
  installable `.apk` to a GitHub Release, or ship through any non-Play
  channel, until that package is registered by hand** in the Android
  Developer Console, which needs an APK signed with the release key.
  This is why every workflow attaches an `.aab` only. `adb install` for
  local development stays exempt. Confirm the second row appears on the
  Play Console verification page after the first Wear release.
- No uncommitted secrets. `grep -r SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY apps/` and
  friends should return only `.env.example` hits.
- **The one-off SPA-shell cutover gates the next `web@*` release, per
  environment.** Since [decisions § 1268](../architecture/decisions.md) the
  SPA shell is `build/200.html` and `build/index.html` is the prerendered
  landing page. The repo half is merged and guarded; the live distributions
  have to be walked through a three-step order separately, and `prod` and
  `preview` are independent. Publishing a `web@*` Release to an environment
  that has not been through it makes CloudFront serve the *landing page* as
  the body of every deep link -- broken, since its asset URLs resolve under
  the deep link's own directory -- until the `terraform apply` catches up.
  Check before tagging, don't assume:
  `aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id <DIST_ID> --query 'DistributionConfig.CustomErrorResponses.Items[?ErrorCode==`403`].ResponsePagePath' --output text`
  -- `/200.html` means done, `/index.html` means do the cutover first.
  **`prod` was cut over on 2026-09-10 and `web@1.5.0` shipped on top of it**,
  so it needs nothing further; the check above still costs one command and is
  still worth running, because this note is a record of one distribution's
  state and not a guarantee about it. `preview` has never been cut over and
  cannot be: the account holds exactly one distribution and
  `preview.threkir.com` resolves to nothing, so that environment is unbuilt
  rather than pending. The order, its rollback and the claim in it that is now
  measured rather than derived are in [`deployment.md` § One-off: the
  SPA-shell cutover from
  `index.html` to `200.html`](deployment.md#one-off-the-spa-shell-cutover-from-indexhtml-to-200html).
- **Supabase Auth URL configuration (every release, web or mobile).**
  In the hosted project's dashboard, confirm **Authentication → URL
  Configuration**: **Site URL** is the prod origin (`https://threkir.com`,
  never the `http://localhost:3000` default), and **Redirect URLs**
  contains `https://threkir.com/auth/callback`,
  `https://threkir.com/auth/reset`, `com.threkir.app://login-callback`,
  and the preview origin. A wrong Site URL or a missing allow-list entry
  lands a signup confirmation on `/?code=…` instead of `/auth/callback`,
  which used to mint a live session with an unstamped GDPR Art 8 consent
  record. The app fails closed in code (issue #363), but this is a
  privacy-boundary config gate — verify it, don't assume the guard.
  Details: [web_app_auth.md § Production setup](../features/web_app_auth.md).
- **Supabase Auth email confirmations.** **Authentication → Providers →
  Email → Confirm email** is **ON** in prod (`enable_confirmations =
  true`). Local config keeps it off on purpose; prod must not. Closes the
  sign-up account-existence oracle (issue #399).
- If this is a first release on a new device, the test plan section in
  `apps/<app>/local_testing.md` has been smoke-run.
