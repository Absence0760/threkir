// Source-grep guards on the /dashboard mount sequence. Run with
// `npx tsx --test apps/web/src/lib/core/dashboard_load.test.ts`.
//
// The mount is a Svelte onMount that issues ~15 Supabase reads; it can't be
// unit-tested without a stack. Pin the shape in the source instead, the same
// way coach/context.test.ts pins its no-duplicate-get_my_profile invariant.
//
// The dashboard is the app's highest-traffic page. It used to run six serial
// stages after its opening batch, two of which re-read something an earlier
// stage had already fetched: `loadSettings` (two selects) and `get_my_profile`
// (one) were each called twice. The reads have no dependency on each other, so
// they belong in the opening batch.
//
// The dependency that IS real: `loadTodaysNutrition` reads `runs` and
// `gymWorkouts`, and the fitness-snapshot write reads `runs`. Both must stay
// downstream of the batch that fills them.
