// audit/cookie-consent + audit/third-party-data-flows (May 2026)
// flagged that server-side Sentry initialised + intercepted every
// request before the user had seen the consent banner. EU IPs were
// forwarded to a US sub-processor (Sentry) under no lawful basis.
//
// Three-layer gate (self-audit caught that the original two-layer
// version still leaked 5xx errors via handleErrorWithSentry):
//   1. Sentry.init() runs once at module load — keep the dev/dsn
//      condition; the client never gets a chance to consent if the
//      server isn't even configured for tracing.
//   2. The handle middleware that wires sentryHandle() into the
//      request flow now reads the consent cookie per-request (via
//      isConsentGiven, which is a pure cookie-parsing helper so
//      the gate stays unit-testable without Svelte runtime).
//      Requests without an "accepted" cookie skip Sentry entirely —
//      no IP capture, no traces sent.
//   3. handleError is wrapped to do the same consent check before
//      capturing. Sentry's handleErrorWithSentry calls
//      captureException unconditionally for 5xx errors; a server
//      error from an unconsented user would otherwise still ship
//      the stack + URL + IP to Sentry. The wrapped version logs
//      the error to stderr (so it still surfaces in CloudWatch /
//      Lambda logs) and skips the Sentry call.
//
// The cookie is written by the client-side consent module
// ($lib/settings/consent.svelte). When the user accepts, the cookie ships
// on the next request; when they reset, it's cleared. Requests
// before the banner is interacted with have no cookie and are
// excluded.

// no argument there is nothing to infer `T` from, and it resolves to the
// CONSTRAINT — `(input: never) => unknown` — not the default, which makes the
// wrapped hook reject its own input and return `unknown`. Naming SvelteKit's
// own `HandleServerError` says what this hook is instead of relying on an
// inference fallback that already moved once.
