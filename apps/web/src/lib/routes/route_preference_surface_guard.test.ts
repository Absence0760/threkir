// The route-design preference, as the runner meets it (decisions.md § 795-798).
//
// The wire carries at most ONE preference, so the control has to be
// single-choice: three checkboxes would let a runner express a state the
// request cannot represent and leave the page to discard two of them
// silently. And a preference is an enhancement the generator may decline, so
// the page must report the preference the SERVER applied rather than the one
// the runner asked for — fail-closed, because a deployment predating the
// field sends nothing and reading nothing as success makes the disclosure
// vanish exactly where it is needed.
//
// None of that is visible to a unit test of the generator: the handler tests
// pin what the 200 body says, and these pin what the page does with it.
