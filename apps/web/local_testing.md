# Local testing — Web app (SvelteKit)

The web app is a SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 project at `apps/web/`. The canonical package manager is **npm** via the root workspace ([decisions.md § 7](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md)) — that's what CI runs. The historical `apps/web/pnpm-lock.yaml` lets `pnpm` work locally too; either is fine, just don't mix in the same checkout.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Install |
|---|---|
| Node.js 20 LTS | `nodejs.org` |
| pnpm 9.x | `npm install -g pnpm` |
| Local backend running | See [../backend/local_testing.md](../backend/local_testing.md) |
| MapTiler API key | Free at maptiler.com/cloud (for map tiles) |

---

## Setup

```bash
cd apps/web

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your local backend values:

```bash
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:24321
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<publishable-key-from-supabase-status>
PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY=<your-maptiler-key>
```

---

## Seed the database

Before running the web app for the first time, seed the local database with test data:

```bash
cd apps/backend
supabase db reset
```

This creates a test user and populates all tables. Log in with:

- **Email:** `runner@test.com`
- **Password:** `testtest`

See [../backend/local_testing.md](../backend/local_testing.md) for details on what the seed includes.

---

## Running

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Opens at **http://localhost:7777**.

---

## Other commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev` | Dev server with hot reload on `:7777` |
| `pnpm build` | Production build |
| `pnpm preview` | Preview production build on `:8888` |
| `pnpm check` | Type-check all Svelte and TypeScript files |

## Testing external integrations

Each integration below is independent — you can skip the ones you're not touching. The seed user (`runner@test.com` / `testtest`) is the easiest baseline; sign in with email and add the integration on top.

### OAuth: Google sign-in + linking

The web app supports Google as a sign-in provider on `/login` and as a *link* on `/settings/account` (attaches Google to an existing account).

**Setup**
1. [Google Auth Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/overview) → **Clients** → **Create client** (type: Web application). Authorized redirect URIs: the Supabase callback URL printed by `supabase status` (looks like `http://localhost:24321/auth/v1/callback`) — that is the only URI Google itself redirects to; `http://localhost:7777/auth/callback` is Supabase's hop afterwards and belongs in its Redirect URLs, though listing it here too is harmless. Prod walkthrough, including the Android + iOS clients: [`docs/ops/google_provisioning.md`](../../docs/ops/google_provisioning.md).
2. Local Supabase: edit `apps/backend/supabase/config.toml`, find `[auth.external.google]`, set `enabled = true` and paste `client_id` + `secret`. Restart the local stack (`supabase stop && supabase start` from `apps/backend/`).
3. For the **link-on-existing-account** flow, also flip on **Manual linking** in `[auth]` (`enable_manual_linking = true` in `config.toml`). Without this, `linkIdentity()` returns `manual_linking_disabled`.

**Test path**
1. Sign-up flow: `/login` → "Continue with Google" → consent screen → land back on `/dashboard` as a brand-new user. Verify a row in `auth.identities` (Studio at `:24323` → schema `auth` → table `identities`).
2. Linking flow: sign in with email → `/settings/account` → **Link Google** → consent for the *same* Google account → return to settings. The "Sign-in Methods" card should now list two rows (email + Google) with the same `user_id`.
3. Unlink flow: click **Unlink** on Google → confirm. Row disappears; the **Unlink** button on the remaining email identity is disabled with the "you need at least one" tooltip.

**Common failures**
- *"redirect_uri_mismatch"* on the Google consent screen → the URL in your browser doesn't match what's authorised in the Google client. Add it.
- *Returns to `/login` with no session* → Supabase callback URL not in the Google client's allow-list, or `config.toml` not reloaded after editing.

### OAuth: Apple sign-in + linking

Same pattern as Google. Apple requires a paid developer account and a more involved setup (Service ID + key + signed JWT secret) — skip for local-only testing unless you specifically need to verify Apple paths.

**Setup**
1. Apple Developer portal: create a Services ID, configure Sign in with Apple, add `http://localhost:7777/auth/callback` and the Supabase callback as Return URLs, generate a Sign in with Apple key, and produce a JWT secret (Supabase docs have the snippet).
2. `[auth.external.apple]` in `config.toml`: `enabled = true`, `client_id = <services_id>`, `secret = <jwt-secret>`.
3. Manual linking enabled (same flag as above).

**Test path**: identical to Google — sign in fresh, then a separate run of "Link Apple" on an email account. **Apple-specific gotcha**: Apple often returns an `@privaterelay.appleid.com` email; the linked-identity row will show that, not the user's real email. That's expected.

### AI coach (Anthropic and Ollama)

The coach endpoint at `/api/coach/+server.ts` supports two providers, picked by `COACH_PROVIDER` in `.env.local`.

**Prod path — Anthropic (default)**
1. `COACH_PROVIDER=anthropic` (or unset), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`.
2. Visit `/coach` → confirm the "Grounded in:" strip lists your active plan (or "No active plan"), the runs count, and HR-zone status.
3. Send a message ("How's my pace?") → response arrives within ~3s. The usage bar at the bottom shows cache numbers (`read N · wrote N · in N · out N`); the second message in the same conversation should show non-zero `read` (cache hit).
4. Switch the **Last N runs** chip to a different value and send another message. `runs_limit` is reflected in the prompt; the chip count updates immediately.
5. With multiple plans, the header `<select>` lets you swap; URL gains `?plan=<id>` and the chat resets.

**Local path — Ollama**
1. `ollama pull llama3.2` (or any model you have). Confirm `ollama serve` is running on `:11434`.
2. In `.env.local`:
   ```
   COACH_PROVIDER=openai
   OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
   OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama
   OPENAI_MODEL=llama3.2
   ```
3. `pnpm dev` (restart so Vite picks up env changes), open `/coach`, send a message. Responses are slower and lower-quality; that's expected for a 7–8B local model.
4. Switch back to Anthropic by setting `COACH_PROVIDER=anthropic` and restarting — no other changes needed.

**Tier-aware budget (priority processing)**
1. As a free user (default seed), open `/coach` → footer shows a small "Free" badge and "2 of 2 messages remaining today".
2. Send a message → DevTools → Network tab → response headers should include `X-Coach-Tier: free`, `X-RateLimit-Limit: 2`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 1`, `X-RateLimit-MaxTokens: 768`, `X-RateLimit-MaxRuns: 30`.
3. Flip `subscription_tier` to `pro` in Studio (`update user_profiles set subscription_tier = 'pro' where id = '...';`) and reload `/coach`. Footer changes to "Pro · 10 of 10 messages remaining today · priority context window".
4. Send a message → response headers now read `X-Coach-Tier: pro`, `X-RateLimit-Limit: 10`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 9`, `X-RateLimit-MaxTokens: 2048`, `X-RateLimit-MaxRuns: 75`. Pro answers visibly run longer when the question warrants it.
5. With `BYPASS_PAYWALL=true`, the server reports `tier: 'pro'` regardless of the user's actual subscription so you can dev against the Pro shape without paying RevenueCat. The bypass also skips the daily-cap increment entirely so you can iterate without burning quota.

**Common failures**
- *503 with "Coach is not configured"* → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` missing while `COACH_PROVIDER=anthropic`.
- *502 "coach upstream 4xx"* on Ollama path → model name mismatch (try `ollama list`) or Ollama not running.
- *429 with daily-limit message* → tier daily cap hit (free: 2/day, pro: 10/day). Either set `BYPASS_PAYWALL=true` in `.env.local`, flip the seed user's `subscription_tier` to `pro` in Studio for a higher cap, or `delete from user_coach_usage where user_id = '<seed>';` to reset today's counter.

### Cross-platform syncing (web ↔ mobile)

There's no separate sync service — every client writes to the same Supabase project and RLS scopes data by `user_id`. Linking Google or Apple just means multiple sign-in methods point at the same `user_id`, so any device signed in with any of them sees the same runs.

**Test path — emulator on the same machine**
1. Run web on `:7777` and the local Supabase stack on `:24321`.
2. Run `apps/mobile_android` in an Android emulator (see `apps/mobile_android/local_testing.md`). Point its Supabase URL at **`http://10.0.2.2:24321`** — Android's emulator alias for the host's loopback. `localhost` from inside the emulator is the emulator itself.
3. Sign in on both clients as `runner@test.com`. Record a run on Android (or use the manual-add modal on web).
4. Refresh `/runs` on web (or pull-to-refresh on Android) — the row should appear on the other side. Watch the `runs` table in Studio (`:24323`) for the live insert.

**Test path — real phone over LAN**
1. Web + Supabase running on your laptop. Note your LAN IP (`ipconfig getifaddr en0` on macOS).
2. Phone on the same Wi-Fi. Configure the mobile app's Supabase URL as `http://<lan-ip>:24321`.
3. Add `http://<lan-ip>:24321` to `[auth] additional_redirect_urls` in `config.toml` if you're testing OAuth from the phone.

**Test path — hosted Supabase project**
Easiest for cross-network testing: web `.env.local` and the mobile app both point at the same hosted project URL + anon key. No emulator gymnastics.

### Strava import

`/settings/integrations` connects via OAuth and pulls activities into `runs`.

**Setup**
1. Strava developer portal → create an app → set "Authorization Callback Domain" to `localhost`. Copy the client ID + secret.
2. `.env.local`:
   ```
   PUBLIC_STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=<id>
   STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=<id>
   STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>
   ```
3. Backend Edge Functions need the secret too — see `apps/backend/local_testing.md`.

**Test path**
1. `/settings/integrations` → **Connect Strava** → Strava OAuth screen → return.
2. Click **Sync now** → activities populate. Filter `/runs` by Source: Strava to verify.
3. Disconnect → row removed from `integrations`; subsequent sync attempts return "not connected".

### Web push notifications

The subscribe path works locally as soon as you set a VAPID public key in `.env.local`; actually delivering pushes needs an Edge Function with the matching private key (follow-up).

**Generate a keypair**
```bash
npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
# → Public Key:  BPx... (64-byte URL-safe base64)
# → Private Key: AbC... (32-byte URL-safe base64)
```

Drop the public half into `apps/web/.env.local` as `PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=...`. The private half is for the (future) Edge Function — keep it out of the browser bundle.

**Test path**
1. `pnpm dev` → `/settings/account` → scroll to **Notifications**.
2. With no key set: card shows "not configured" copy. Set `PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` and restart dev — the **Enable notifications** button appears.
3. Click **Enable** → browser prompts for permission → grant → toast "Notifications enabled on this device.".
4. Verify in Supabase: `select prefs from user_device_settings where user_id = '...';` — the row for this browser's device id should now have a `push_subscription` key with `endpoint` + `keys.p256dh` + `keys.auth`.
5. Click **Disable** → subscription drops; the row's `push_subscription` is removed.
6. Browser-deny path: in your browser site settings, block notifications → reload `/settings/account` → card switches to "blocked at the browser level" copy with no Enable button.

Sending a real push from the server is out of scope here. To verify the SW end-to-end, hand-craft a push via your browser's devtools (Application → Service Workers → Push), with a JSON body like `{"title":"Test","body":"Hello","url":"/dashboard"}` — the system notification should fire and clicking it focuses (or opens) `/dashboard`.

### Garmin bulk import

Garmin Connect's live OAuth API is gated on Garmin's developer-program approval, so the web ships a **bulk FIT importer** as the user-side path instead.

**Test path**
1. `/settings/integrations` → **Bulk import from a Garmin export** → **Choose Garmin export**.
2. Pick either:
   - A single `.fit` file (Garmin Connect → any activity → **Export Original**), or
   - The big `.zip` from `Garmin → Account Management → Request Your Data` (multi-GB, contains every recorded activity).
3. Watch the progress bar — `imported / skipped / failed` should converge as files are decoded. The current filename ticks underneath.
4. Verify on `/runs` that new rows appear with the **garmin** source pill, and the run-detail map renders the trace from the FIT records. Open the run-detail HR-zones card — `metadata.avg_bpm` and the time-weighted zone breakdown should both populate when the FIT carries HR samples.
5. Re-import the same file — every row should land in **skipped** (matched on `metadata.garmin_id` for FIT entries, on `started_at|distance_m` for any GPX/TCX originals nested inside the bundle).

The FIT decoder (`fit-file-parser`) is dynamic-imported so the integrations page is only ~260 KB heavier when a Garmin file is actually picked.

### parkrun import

No OAuth — the user types their parkrun athlete number into `/settings/account`.

**Test path**
1. Set `parkrun_number` on the profile form (any 6-digit number works for testing the wire-up; real numbers are needed for actual results).
2. `/settings/integrations` → **Sync parkrun** → results pull in tagged with `metadata.event = 'parkrun'` and `metadata.position = N`.
3. Verify a row on `/runs` with the **parkrun** source pill.

### RevenueCat (Pro tier checkout)

Optional — only needed if you're touching the paywall flow. Without `PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_WEB_CHECKOUT_URL`, `/settings/upgrade` falls back to a "coming soon" toast. The web flow is a hosted-checkout redirect now (no embedded SDK).

**Test path**
1. Set `PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_WEB_CHECKOUT_URL` in `.env.local` to your RevenueCat sandbox Web Paywall Link (`https://pay.rev.cat/<token>`); optionally `PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_WEB_PORTAL_URL` for the manage-subscription link.
2. `/settings/upgrade` → **Get Pro** → the browser redirects to the hosted RevenueCat checkout (with your user id as the App User ID + a `redirect_url` back to the page).
3. Use a test card; on completion RevenueCat redirects back, the webhook flips the user's `subscription_tier` to `pro`, and the coach's daily cap is raised.

**Bypass for non-paywall work**: set `BYPASS_PAYWALL=true` in `.env.local` to skip every tier check server-side without involving RevenueCat at all.

## Project structure

The route + component tree drifts fast as features ship. The canonical
inventory now lives in [`apps/web/CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) (see its
Folder Structure block) and stays current alongside the code.

A short orientation, organised by capability rather than by folder:

- **Auth + entry**: `routes/login/`, `routes/auth/callback/`, `routes/+layout.svelte` (sidebar shell with collapsible state, notification bell, profile button).
- **Stats + history**: `routes/dashboard/`, `routes/dashboard/period/[type]/[date]/`, `routes/runs/`, `routes/runs/[id]/`, `routes/feed/`.
- **Routes**: `routes/routes/` (tabs: My + Explore), `routes/routes/new/` (builder), `routes/routes/[id]/`, `routes/explore/` (thin redirect).
- **Sharing (public, no auth)**: `routes/share/run/[id]/`, `routes/share/route/[id]/`, `routes/u/[id]/`, `routes/live/[id]/`, `routes/live/event/[id]/[instance]/`.
- **Social**: `routes/clubs/`, `routes/clubs/new/`, `routes/clubs/[slug]/`, `routes/clubs/[slug]/events/new/`, `routes/clubs/[slug]/events/[id]/`, `routes/clubs/join/[token]/`.
- **Plans + coach**: `routes/plans/`, `routes/plans/new/`, `routes/plans/[id]/`, `routes/plans/[id]/workouts/[wid]/`, `routes/coach/`, `routes/api/coach/+server.ts`.
- **Settings**: `routes/settings/{account,preferences,integrations,devices,upgrade,licenses}/`.
- **Manual creation**: `routes/runs/new/` (alongside the modal-hosted `RunEditor`).
- **Lib**: `lib/data.ts` (every Supabase query), `lib/types.ts` (overlays), `lib/training.ts` (VDOT engine), `lib/training_load.ts` (TRIMP / fitness / fatigue / form), `lib/segments.ts`, `lib/privacy.ts`, `lib/route_history.ts`, `lib/strava-zip.ts`, `lib/garmin-zip.ts`, `lib/garmin-fit.ts`, `lib/push.ts`, `lib/settings.ts`, `lib/units.svelte.ts`, `lib/map-style.svelte.ts`, `lib/theme.ts`. Stores under `lib/stores/` (`auth`, `toast`, `notifications`).
- **Components** (under `lib/components/`): `RunMap`, `RunTrackPreview`, `TrackPreview`, `ElevationProfile`, `RouteBuilder`, `RouteExplorer`, `ImportRoute`, `RunEditor`, `ClubEditor`, `EventEditor`, `PlanEditor`, `PlanMetaEditor`, `PlanCalendar`, `TrainingLoadChart`, `PeriodSummary`, `CoachChat`, `RunSocial`, `RunPhotos`, `RunSegmentEfforts`, `SegmentsPanel`, `RunShareView`, `NotificationBell`, `NotificationsList`, `PrivacyZonePicker`, `LicenseList`, `Modal`, `ConfirmDialog`, `ToastContainer`, `ProGate`, `SplitPane`, `WorkoutEditor`.
- **Top-level files**: `src/app.html`, `src/app.css`, `src/app.d.ts`, `svelte.config.js`, `vite.config.ts`, `package.json`. The repo bootstrapped with pnpm so `apps/web/pnpm-lock.yaml` exists alongside the npm workspace; CI uses npm.

---

## Conventions

- Use **Svelte 5 runes** syntax (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`) — not the legacy options API
- TypeScript throughout — `lang="ts"` on all `<script>` blocks
- Scoped CSS in `.svelte` files — no global utility classes

---

## Troubleshooting

### Map showing grey tiles or not loading

Your MapTiler API key is missing or invalid. Sign up at maptiler.com/cloud for a free key and add it to `.env.local` as `PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY`.

### "Failed to fetch" errors in the browser

The local Supabase backend isn't running. Start it first — see [../backend/local_testing.md](../backend/local_testing.md).

### Type errors after pulling changes

```bash
pnpm check
```

If types are out of sync with the backend schema, update `src/lib/types.ts` to match.

### Port 7777 already in use

Another instance of the dev server is running. Kill it or use a different port:

```bash
pnpm dev --port 3000
```
