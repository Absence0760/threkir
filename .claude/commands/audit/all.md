description: Run the full audit sweep — security + privacy + invariants + dep health — in parallel
argument-hint: [security|invariants|data|deps|infra|cost|compliance] (optional area filter)
---

Run the project's full audit sweep. By default, runs every audit; with an argument, runs the named subset.

## Areas

- **security** — `audit/auth`, `audit/rls`, `audit/storage`, `audit/edge-functions`, `audit/xss`, `audit/secrets`, `audit/public-rows`, `audit/paywall`
- **privacy** — `audit/privacy-zones`, `audit/pii-in-logs`
- **invariants** — `audit/twin-parity`, `audit/schema-drift`, `audit/metadata-keys`, `audit/architecture-guards`, `audit/layered-resilience`
- **data** — `audit/db-design`, `audit/db-performance`, `audit/migration-locks`
- **deps** — `audit/deps`, `audit/licenses`
- **infra** — `audit/infra` (AWS Terraform stacks)
- **cost** — `audit/cost-controls` (per-user + global spend ceilings)
- **compliance** — `audit/gdpr`, `audit/data-export-completeness`, `audit/account-deletion-completeness`, `audit/third-party-data-flows`, `audit/cookie-consent`, `audit/regional-availability`, `audit/accessibility`, `audit/app-store-privacy`, `audit/i18n-readiness`

## Procedure

1. Decide which audits to run based on `$ARGUMENTS`:
   - No argument → all audits
   - `security` → security + privacy
   - `invariants` → invariants subset
   - `data` → data subset (db-design + db-performance + migration-locks)
   - `deps` → deps + licenses
   - `infra` → infra only
   - `cost` → cost-controls only
   - `compliance` → compliance subset (international launch readiness)
2. **Spawn the right agent per audit area, in parallel.** Send all dispatches in a single message with multiple tool calls.
   - Security + privacy areas (`auth`, `rls`, `storage`, `edge-functions`, `xss`, `secrets`, `public-rows`, `paywall`, `privacy-zones`): each is a separate `repo-security-auditor` invocation, with the audit area passed as the prompt's first sentence. Each gets the corresponding `.claude/commands/audit/<name>.md` body as its full instruction.
   - Compliance areas (`gdpr`, `data-export-completeness`, `account-deletion-completeness`, `third-party-data-flows`, `cookie-consent`, `regional-availability`, `accessibility`, `pii-in-logs`, `licenses`): each is a separate `compliance-auditor` invocation with the audit area as the prompt's first sentence.
   - Data areas (`db-design`, `db-performance`, `migration-locks`): each is a separate `data-architecture-auditor` invocation with the scope/area as the prompt's first sentence.
   - `app-store-privacy`: separate `app-store-privacy-auditor` invocation.
   - `i18n-readiness`: separate `i18n-readiness-auditor` invocation.
   - `metadata-keys`: spawn `metadata-key-keeper` for the per-key sweep, OR an Explore agent if you need broader codebase scan beyond a single diff.
   - `deps`: a single Explore agent with the `deps.md` prompt is fine — the work is mostly running each tool in turn.
   - `infra`: a single `general-purpose` agent with the `infra.md` prompt — reads ~30 small `.tf` files plus the apply walkthrough.
   - `cost-controls`: a single `general-purpose` agent with the `cost-controls.md` prompt — cross-cuts code + IaC + migrations + docs, doesn't fit one specialised auditor.
3. While the agents run, run the local checks that don't need an agent:
   - `audit/twin-parity` — single `diff -rq` (or invoke `mobile-twin-mirror` if there's drift to fix; otherwise handle inline)
   - `audit/architecture-guards` — run the three test suites inline
   - `audit/schema-drift` — `gen:types:check` + `dart run scripts/gen_dart_models.dart` + `git diff --stat` (or invoke `migration-coordinator` if drift is from an in-progress migration)
   - `audit/layered-resilience` — read-walk the recording stack inline (no agent today; Explore is overkill for a single-file walk)
4. **Consolidate findings** into a single report grouped by severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low), then by audit area. For each finding: file:line, what's wrong, the audit that found it.
5. **Recommend a fix order**, but don't apply fixes without explicit confirmation. Critical/High findings should be flagged with "fix this before next deploy"; Medium/Low can be batched.

**Per-lane scratchpad.** Every lane of this fan-out inherits ONE scratchpad path from the session, and `isolation: "worktree"` does not separate it — a bare filename written by one lane is read back by another. Name each lane's own `<scratchpad>/<lane-slug>/` in its prompt and tell it to keep every temporary file under there, never in the scratchpad root and never in `/tmp`. A lane that mutates a file to test something restores it with `git checkout HEAD -- <path>`, never a `.bak` copy ([CLAUDE.md § Working alongside other Claude sessions](../../../CLAUDE.md)).

## Output shape

```
# Audit report — <date>

## Critical (N)
- [audit/<area>] file:line — <one-line>
- ...

## High (N)
- ...

## Medium (N)
- ...

## Low (N)
- ...

## Recommended order
1. ...
2. ...
```

## Notes

- This is read-only. Each sub-audit is read-only by default.
- The report is the deliverable; do not edit code based on findings without asking the user first.
- If an audit finds no issues, list it under a `## Clean` section — easier to spot regression on the next run.

## Output → `reviews/`

Persist the findings to `reviews/audit-all.md` (gitignored working notes — see [`reviews/README.md`](../../../reviews/README.md)), not only to chat. One finding per entry with a `[ ]` status box, grouped by severity. If that file already exists from a prior run, update it in place — flip resolved findings to `[x]` (with the fix commit) and keep `[~]` deferred items — instead of overwriting. The audit is otherwise read-only on the codebase; writing this one findings file is the allowed exception.
