# CloudWatch alarms for the eight web Lambdas + the CloudFront distribution.
#
# All alarms route to the same SNS topic per env. Email subscribers are
# managed in Terraform via `var.alert_emails` (per-env tfvars) so a
# topic without a subscriber is impossible to ship — the audit/cost-
# controls Medium flagged that the previous "subscribe out of band"
# step was operationally fragile (an unsubscribed throttle alarm is
# functionally identical to no alarm).
#
# The first apply per address sends an opt-in confirmation email; the
# subscription stays in `pending_confirmation` until the recipient
# clicks the link. Subsequent applies are idempotent.
#
# Every alarm below is DECLARED unconditionally-shaped (so
# scripts/check_infra_coverage.mjs still sees each Lambda's error-rate + p95
# pair) but CREATED per `var.alarm_tier`. The estate's CloudWatch free tier is
# 10 alarm metrics shared across the whole AWS Organization, billed per metric
# (each error-rate alarm below reads two), and this module at "full" is ~40 per
# env. "essential" keeps the alarms that guard spend or total outage — the
# coach error rate, CloudFront 5xx, the three throttle ceilings and the
# bypass-paywall tripwire, 7 alarm metrics — and drops the per-surface and
# latency alarms. A dropped alarm takes its log metric filter with it: a filter
# with `default_value` publishes a custom metric, which has its own 10-metric
# free tier.

# ─────────────────── Distribution-level error rates ───────────────────
#
# This file's own first line said "alarms for the coach Lambda + the CloudFront
# distribution" and apps/web/deployment.md listed a 4xx and a 5xx distribution
# alarm under "CloudWatch alarms (wired by the web-stack module)". Neither
# existed: every alarm here was per-Lambda, so the observability bar that
# document sets for v1 — "someone gets paged when the site is down" — was met by
# nothing. A per-Lambda alarm cannot see a distribution serving errors from S3,
# a broken behaviour ordering, or an origin the OAC has stopped signing for.
#
# Rate metrics, not counts: CloudFront publishes 4xxErrorRate / 5xxErrorRate as
# percentages of requests, so the alarm does not need a traffic-volume baseline
# to be meaningful, and `notBreaching` on missing data keeps a quiet preview env
# out of ALARM.
#
# CloudFront metrics are published ONLY in us-east-1, under a fixed
# `Region = "Global"` dimension. These use the module's default provider rather
# than the aws.us_east_1 alias because a CloudWatch alarm's actions must live in
# the alarm's own region and aws_sns_topic.alerts is created by the default
# provider. Both are us-east-1 today (infra/README.md § Region); moving the
# stack's primary region is already a manual multi-file edit, and this is one
# more file it has to touch.
