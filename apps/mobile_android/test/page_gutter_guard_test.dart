// Source-scan guard for issue #666 C17: a screen disagreeing with itself about
// where its own left edge is.
//
// C17 read "page gutter is 12, 16 or 20". Measured across the app that is
// 66 sites at 12 and 56 at 20 against **201 at 16** — a global convergence
// would be a 122-site restyle of live screens, which is a design call rather
// than a defect. What IS unambiguous is a single screen whose own scroll views
// disagree: `coach_screen` put its header at 20, its transcript at 12 and a
// third surface at 16, so one page had three left edges. Round 18 fixed the two
// library screens' search field; this closes the four remaining real ones and
// pins the rule.
//
// So the invariant is INTERNAL consistency, not a global value. A screen that
// is uniformly at 12 or 20 passes — its edge is coherent to the reader, which
// is what the finding is about.
//
// The four exemptions are each a different KIND of surface, not a page:
//
//  * `club_detail_screen` — the 20 is a modal bottom sheet's own inset
//    (`showDragHandle` + `SafeArea`). A sheet is not the page under it.
//  * `guided_runs_screen` — the 0 is a full-bleed list; edge-to-edge is the
//    layout, not a gutter that drifted.
//  * `onboarding_screen` — 24/32 is the pre-sign-in hero, deliberately roomier
//    than the app behind it.
//  * `run_screen` — 16/24 on the recording surface. § 551 already declined to
//    spend a visual change there for tidiness, and that reasoning holds here.
