# Instructor business readiness — letting a gym / yoga instructor run their class business in the app

> **Status: PARTIALLY BUILT (content track shipped; money track gated).** As of 2026-06-11 the gate-cleared content + ops milestones have landed: **M0** (the [readiness pack](instructor_business_m0_readiness.md), no code), **M2** (`gym_sets.duration_s`), **M3** (gym routine engine P1, web + mobile), **M4** (session plan engine P1, web + mobile read), **M6** (attendance / check-in, web + mobile). The **money track (M1 / M8 / M9 / M10) remains gated** on the M0 sign-offs + Stripe Connect keys; **M7** (the host earnings summary) is **built on web** (2026-10-09, migration `20270723000001`) as a read over whatever orders exist, so it stays empty until M1's charge path writes some; and **M5** (follow-along execution) is now **shipped on both platforms** (spoken cues only on the mobile session runner; the gym runner and both web runners are silent): the `gym_adherence` / `gym_progression` parity pairs, `expandRoutineSteps`, `computeSessionAdherence`, `workoutDraftFromSession`, the `GymWorkoutRunner` (`packages/run_recorder/lib/src/gym_workout_runner.dart`), and the `gym_workouts.metadata` execution trios merged 2026-06-11; the web players are `SessionRunner.svelte` + `SessionExecutionBand.svelte` and `GymSessionRunner.svelte` + `GymExecutionBand.svelte`; the mobile twins are `screens/gym_session_screen.dart` + `widgets/gym_execution_band.dart` (gym) and the `_SessionRunnerPage` / `_SessionExecutionBand` inside `screens/session_detail_screen.dart` (session follow-along), both driving the same expanded-step helpers and both logging a `gym_workout` carrying the metadata trio. This is a sequencing document, not a new spec — it ties three existing specs ([club_events.md](club_events.md), [gym_programming.md](gym_programming.md), [session_planner.md](session_planner.md)) into one ordered path. Nothing ships without the per-milestone gate being met — and the payment go-live milestone carries a **hard compliance gate** (owner + CISO + counsel sign-off under SOC 2 / GovRAMP).

> **North star check.** Per [multi_modal.md](multi_modal.md) and [club_events.md](club_events.md), the instructor business is **a retention + community layer in service of the individual athlete, not a second business.** We are not building Mindbody/ClassPass. Every milestone below earns its place by deepening the core app — the payoff is that an attended class lands in the student's Train history and feeds the same cross-modal Coach context as their runs and lifts. If a slice doesn't serve that, it doesn't ship.

> **Sibling feature.** Race-director operations ([race_director_ops.md](race_director_ops.md), decisions §154) is the race-side counterpart of this class-side path: it extends the same typed-events + Stripe Connect host-payout rail with offline aid-station check-in (`event_checkpoints` + `checkpoint_crossings`) → live results + cutoff projection, monetizable through the identical `events-*` functions.

## The two personas

Two read-only persona bug-hunters drive this plan (`.claude/agents/personas/`):

- **`gym-class-instructor`** — strength / HIIT / spin / bootcamp coach. Class content is a **gym routine** (exercises × sets × reps × **load**, supersets, planned-vs-actual). Capacity = spots/bikes/racks.
- **`yoga-pilates-instructor`** — the canonical "Dani" the typed-events spec was written around. Class content is a **timed pose sequence** (holds, per-side, breath/alignment cues, flow order — **no load**). Capacity = mats/reformers.

They share ~80% of the journey (scheduling, getting paid to the *host* not the club, capacity/waitlist, refunds, cross-modal logging) and diverge only on the **content engine** (gym routine vs session plan). The plan reflects that: one shared core, two thin content tracks.

## What "seamless" means (the business journey)

The end-to-end loop an instructor must complete without leaving the app or hitting a dead end:

| # | Step | Persona need |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Set up to get paid** | Onboard a payout account once; money lands in *my* account, not the club's |
| 2 | **Schedule a class** | Typed `class` event, recurrence, hard capacity, drop-in price |
| 3 | **Members register + pay** | Drop-in without club-join; a paid order *is* the spot; waitlist when full |
| 4 | **Author the class content** | Build/reuse the workout (gym routine) or the sequence (session plan) |
| 5 | **Teach / follow along** | Teach from the content; students follow along at home |
| 6 | **Class lands in student history** | Attending logs a `gym_workout` → feeds their recovery/load curve (the cross-modal payoff) |
| 7 | **Run the day** | See who registered; mark who actually attended |
| 8 | **Handle changes** | Cancel an occurrence → every paid registrant auto-refunded |
| 9 | **Get paid out + reconcile** | See earnings per class / month; trust the payout |
| 10 | **Do it from my phone** | Register / manage on mobile, not only web |

## Current state — verified in code

Confirmed by reading migrations + source on 2026-06-11 (not just trusting the docs):

| Step | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Payout onboarding | **Built (web), live path dark** | `/settings/payouts/+page.svelte`, `events-connect-onboard`, `instructor_payout_accounts` (`20261229_001`). No Stripe Connect test keys → never exercised live. |
| 2 Schedule typed class | **Shipped** | `events.category`/`discipline` (`20261227_001`), `EventEditor.svelte` type-first, web/mobile read (`event_detail_screen.dart`). |
| 3 Register + pay | **Rail built (web), charge dark** | `events-checkout` (destination charge), `stripe-events-webhook` (idempotent, service-role), `event_pricing`/`event_orders`. Drop-in policy verified. Charge unverified (no keys). |
| 4 Author content | **Shipped (P1, M3+M4)** | Gym routine engine P1 — `gym_routines` / `gym_routine_exercises` / `gym_routine_sets` + `gym_workouts.metadata` (migration `20270101_001`), the `gym_routine` parity helper, `/gym/routines` library + builder + detail, "Save as routine" / "Repeat last", web **and** mobile twin ([gym_programming.md](gym_programming.md)). Session plan engine P1 — `session_plans` / `_blocks` / `_items` (migration `20270103_001`), `expandSessionSteps` parity pair, `SessionPlanEditor` + `/sessions` + class-event attach, web canonical + mobile read ([session_planner.md](session_planner.md)). Both authoring-only (no execution). |
| 5 Teach / follow along | **Shipped web + mobile (M5)** | The `GymWorkoutRunner` (`packages/run_recorder`) + the adherence/progression/expand/session parity pairs + the metadata trios are merged. Web: `SessionRunner.svelte` + `SessionExecutionBand.svelte` on `/sessions/[id]` and `GymSessionRunner.svelte` + `GymExecutionBand.svelte` for the routine runner. Mobile: `screens/gym_session_screen.dart` + `widgets/gym_execution_band.dart`, and the `_SessionRunnerPage` inside `screens/session_detail_screen.dart`. Each logs a `gym_workout` carrying its metadata trio. |
| 6 Cross-modal log | **Shipped (M5) — rich log now the primary path** | The follow-along runners log the authored content directly: `workoutDraftFromSession` (or `workoutDraftFromTemplate` as the flat-template fallback) plus per-step `session_step_results` / `gym_step_results` and the adherence verdict in `gym_workouts.metadata`, with timed holds landing in `gym_sets.duration_s` (M2, `20261231_001`). One-tap "Log this as a workout" from a flat class template remains for classes with no authored plan. |
| 7 Attendance | **Shipped (M6)** | `event_attendees.attendance` (`attended` / `no_show`, NULL until marked, migration `20270102_001`) + the organiser-only `mark_attendance` SECURITY DEFINER RPC (sole write path); host marking UI on web + mobile twin, read-only for non-hosts. Orthogonal to RSVP `status`. |
| 8 Cancel → refund | **Schema P1, coupling P2** | `event_exceptions` cancel + `notify_event_cancel` shipped; automated `refund_orders_for_instance` is deferred (P2). Host-cancel refunds are still manual via Stripe dashboard — and **a manual dashboard refund on a destination charge reverses nothing unless the operator ticks it**, so the platform absorbs the whole ticket while the instructor keeps it ([decisions § 769](../architecture/decisions.md), and the pre-deploy checklist in [club_events.md § Refunds](club_events.md)). The buyer-initiated path (`events-cancel`) sends `reverse_transfer` + `refund_application_fee` and is safe. |
| 9 Earnings / reconcile | **Built (web, M7), live data dark** | `host_earnings_summary()` (migration `20270723000001`, decisions § 1816) + `fetchHostEarnings` + the Earnings section of `/settings/payouts`: registrations, gross, refunded, platform fee and net per class instance, rolled up by month and currency. Pinned by `host_earnings_summary_test.sql`, `host_earnings.test.ts` and `payouts-earnings.spec.ts`. Reads real `event_orders`, so it shows nothing until M1's charge path has written some. Mobile read is M10. |
| 10 Mobile register | **P3** | Mobile has no register / checkout / payout flow on `event_detail_screen.dart` — paid events render read-only (the Discover list shows the price, no purchase path); registration + payment are web-only by design. |

**Also confirmed (now resolved):** `gym_sets` originally had `reps` / `weight_kg` / `rpe` but no `duration_s`. M2 added a nullable `gym_sets.duration_s` (migration `20261231_001`), so a 90 s plank or a timed hold now has a first-class home — this closed `session_planner.md` open question #1.

**Read (updated 2026-08-02):** the content engines (M2/M3/M4), the follow-along execution + rich cross-modal logging (M5), and attendance (M6) have **shipped** web-first with the mobile twins landed. What remains: (a) turning the money on safely — **Track A, still gated** on the M0 sign-offs + Stripe keys; (b) the remaining operational surfaces (earnings M7 — built on web 2026-10-09, automated refunds M8, mobile register M10).

## The three tracks

- **Track A — Make the money real.** Take the built-but-dark payment rail to a verified, signed-off, production-exposed state. Unblocks steps 1, 3, 8, 9. **This is the gating track** — without it the marketplace is theatre.
- **Track B — Make the class teachable + loggable.** Build the content engines: gym routines for the gym persona, session plans for the yoga persona, plus `gym_sets.duration_s` so both log cleanly. Unblocks steps 4, 5, 6.
- **Track C — Run the day.** Attendance/check-in, in-app earnings summary, automated refund-on-cancel coupling, mobile register. Unblocks steps 7, 9, 10 and hardens 8.

Tracks A and B are **independent** — B (content) needs no Stripe keys and no compliance sign-off, so it can proceed in parallel with (or ahead of) A's legal/ops work. That independence is the key scheduling lever: **B is the safe place to build while A waits on people.**

## Milestone sequence

Ordered by value-per-unit-risk. Each milestone is independently shippable and web-first ([§24](../architecture/decisions.md#24-web-is-the-canonical-feature-surface-mobile-and-watches-are-platform-additive)).

### M0 — Decision + go-live readiness pack (Track A, no code) — ✅ Shipped (2026-06-11)
Delivered as [instructor_business_m0_readiness.md](instructor_business_m0_readiness.md). Get the people-decisions moving before building more. Produce: the sign-off checklist (owner + CISO + counsel — see [the gate](#the-compliance-gate-load-bearing)), the sub-processor / DSAR / financial-retention answers (`club_events.md` Compliance), and the operator task to provision Stripe Connect **test** keys (`sk_test_`/`ca_`/`whsec_`, per [local_testing_stubs.md § Stripe Connect](../testing/local_testing_stubs.md)). **Gate to start:** none. **Gate to exit:** decisions assigned, test keys requested.

### M1 — Verify the payment rail end-to-end in test mode (Track A)
With Connect test keys in place, exercise the dark path: onboard a test Express account, price a class, register with `4242…`, assert the `going` row + `order_id`, replay the webhook (assert one grant), cancel and confirm the (manual, P1) refund. Land the Playwright + Deno coverage `club_events.md § Testing` specifies but that couldn't run without keys. **Gate to start:** M0 test keys. **Gate to exit:** green e2e in test mode; no charge logic changes needed, or bugs found are fixed at root.

### M2 — gym_sets.duration_s — first-class timed work (Track B, foundation) — ✅ Shipped (2026-06-11, migration `20261231_001`)
A small schema change that unblocks clean logging for *both* personas (planks, holds, timed intervals). Add nullable `gym_sets.duration_s`; thread it through `GymEditor` / `gym_compose_sheet`, the history rollup, and the parity helpers. **Decide before M5** — that's the logging/runner step where a timed hold must land in `gym_sets` (`session_planner.md` open Q1 phrases it as "before P2", i.e. before its execution+logging slice). **Gate to start:** none (additive). **Gate to exit:** migration + both type generators + twin parity + tests.

### M3 — Gym routine engine P1 (Track B — gym persona content) — ✅ Shipped (2026-06-11, web + mobile, migration `20270101_001`)
Build [gym_programming.md](gym_programming.md) P1 only: reusable routines (exercises × sets × reps × load) + "repeat last", build/save/reuse, no execution. (Supersets and `expandRoutineSteps` are gym_programming P2, not P1 — they land later under M5's execution work.) This is the gym instructor's "author the class content" step. **Gate to start:** owner sign-off (per that spec). **Gate to exit:** P1 file list complete, web-first, twin helper + tests.

### M4 — Session plan engine P1 (Track B — yoga persona content) — ✅ Shipped (2026-06-11, web + mobile read, migration `20270103_001`)
Build [session_planner.md](session_planner.md) P1 only: `session_plans`/`_blocks`/`_items`, the `expandSessionSteps` parity pair, the editor, no execution. The yoga instructor's "author the sequence" step. **Gate to start:** owner sign-off. **Gate to exit:** P1 file list complete; `SessionItemKind` CHECK↔union lockstep; twin helper + tests.

### M5 — The follow-along + log seam (Track B execution, both personas) — Shipped (web + mobile)
The execution slices that turn authored content into a logged activity: gym routine execution + session follow-along runner, each logging a `gym_workout` from the authored plan (`workoutDraftFromSession` falling back to `workoutDraftFromTemplate`). This delivers step 6 richly. The gym side spanned two of gym_programming.md's slices — supersets/`expandRoutineSteps` (P2) then the `GymWorkoutRunner` (P3); the session-plan side is session_planner.md P2. **Pure-logic + runner layer landed 2026-06-11; web session player 2026-06-12; both runners now shipped on both platforms:** `expandRoutineSteps` + the `gym_adherence` / `gym_progression` pairs, `computeSessionAdherence`, `workoutDraftFromSession`, the `GymWorkoutRunner`, and the `gym_workouts.metadata` execution trios, behind `SessionRunner.svelte` / `GymSessionRunner.svelte` on web and `session_detail_screen.dart`'s `_SessionRunnerPage` / `gym_session_screen.dart` on mobile (byte-identical iOS twin). **Gate to start** (met): M3/M4 showed instructors build content. **Gate to exit:** runner state machines + offline + keep-alive (wakelock on both mobile runners), twin parity, tests — all met, with one asymmetry worth knowing: **spoken cues exist only on the mobile session runner** (`_cues.speakGuidedCue` in `session_detail_screen.dart` — switch-sides, step name, countdown). The mobile gym runner and both web runners are silent, so those follow-alongs need eyes on the screen.

### M6 — Attendance / check-in (Track C) — ✅ Shipped (2026-06-11, web + mobile, migration `20270102_001`)
Add an attendance concept distinct from RSVP (`attended` / `no_show`, or a check-in timestamp on `event_attendees`) so the instructor can mark who showed — paid ≠ attended. Host-only write, attendee-readable. **Gate to start:** none (additive, no money). **Gate to exit:** migration + RLS + host UI + tests. **Shipped as the lean enum:** nullable `event_attendees.attendance` (`attended`/`no_show`) + the organiser-only `mark_attendance` RPC as the sole write path (the table's column UPDATE on `attendance` is revoked); host UI web + mobile twin; pgtap + Playwright + Flutter tests. **Per-instance fix (migration `20270130_001`):** the RPC originally lacked an `instance_start` parameter, so marking one occurrence of a recurring class stamped every occurrence; it now takes `p_instance_start` and scopes the write to that single occurrence (web + mobile callers + pgtap updated).

### M7 — In-app earnings / payout summary (Track C) — Built (web, 2026-10-09; migration `20270723000001`)
A host-facing "what I'm owed" surface — registrations + revenue per class / per month, sourced from `event_orders`. **Built web-first:** the `host_earnings_summary()` SECURITY DEFINER RPC returns one row per (class instance, currency) of the caller's orders, `fetchHostEarnings` in `data.ts` reads it, the pure `social/host_earnings.ts` rolls rows up by month without mixing currencies, and `/settings/payouts` gains an Earnings section (per-month totals, a per-class breakdown, a retry on a failed read, an empty state). Three decisions carry it ([decisions § 1816](../architecture/decisions.md)):
- **Scoped to the payee, not the organiser.** The read is `event_orders.host_user_id = auth.uid()` — who was paid — where the table's own SELECT policy is "an organiser of the club". A co-organiser who never hosted sees none of it; a host who is not an organiser sees all of it. It is a definer function rather than a view also because the partial-refund amount lives in `payment_refunds`, which no client role can read.
- **The month is the class's, in the event's own timezone.** An order is filed under the month of the instance it bought, in `events.timezone` (UTC for a NULL or unknown zone), so a 19:00 Los Angeles class on 31 October is October's revenue, not November's.
- **Each status lands in exactly one figure.** `paid` and `partially_refunded` are registrations; `refunded` contributes its gross and an equal refund and no fee (`buildRefundParams` nets both parties to zero); `refund_failed` is reported only as `unsettled_cents`; a partial refund is its non-failed `payment_refunds` children, and one with none is counted in `partial_refunds_unrecorded` so the page can say the refund total is a floor. `net = gross - refunded - fee`.

**Gate to start:** M1 (real orders to summarize) — waived for the code, per CLAUDE.md "Compliance sign-offs gate prod, not code": the read-only summary needs no keys and exposes nothing until orders exist. **Gate to exit:** read-only summary + tests — met (pgtap, node:test, Playwright). **Mobile:** deferred to M10 ("payout summary read"); hosts manage payouts on web.

**Platform-fee half — built (2026-10-09, migration `20270723000002`, [decisions § 1817](../architecture/decisions.md)).** The operator's view of the same ledgers: `/admin/earnings` shows the application fees the platform kept per **UTC** calendar month of sale and currency (gross, given back by refunds, net), all-time totals, and any month split by host + club. Backed by `admin_platform_fee_months()` / `admin_platform_fees_by_host(p_month)`, both gated on the `app_admins` allow-list (a host is refused), over `private.platform_fee_lines()`, which states the fee rules once: `refunded` and `refund_failed` give back the whole fee, `partially_refunded` gives back its pro-rata share — an upper bound on event orders, whose refund rows can be incomplete, and the page says so. Read-only, so it carries no compliance gate of its own; it has nothing real to sum until M1 puts live orders in the ledger. Pinned by `platform_fee_earnings_test.sql`, `platform_fee_summary.test.ts` and `tests-e2e/admin/earnings.spec.ts`.

### M8 — Automated refund-on-cancel coupling (Track C, hardens step 8)
[club_events.md](club_events.md) P2: `refund_orders_for_instance`, buyer self-cancel per `refund_policy`, waitlist notify-to-pay, reconciliation sweep. Removes the manual-dashboard-refund risk that most threatens the non-technical instructor's reputation — and, since [decisions § 769](../architecture/decisions.md), a second risk that threatens the *platform*: a dashboard refund that does not reverse the destination transfer is paid entirely out of the platform balance. `refund_orders_for_instance` must build its refunds through the same `buildRefundParams` shape `events-cancel` uses. **Gate to start:** M1 verified + P1 conversion signal. **Gate to exit:** P2 file list + idempotency/refund tests.

### M9 — Production payment go-live (Track A — THE gate)
Flip the marketplace on in production: live Stripe keys, the compliance sign-off complete, sub-processor list + Privacy Policy updated, DSAR export/delete paths cover `event_orders` + `instructor_payout_accounts`. **Gate to start:** M1 green + **owner + CISO + counsel sign-off**. **Strongly recommended before exposing to strangers' money, not a hard prerequisite:** M8 (automated refunds) — see the note below. **Gate to exit:** live, monitored, rollback documented.

> **M8 is a recommendation, not a hard gate on M9 — deliberately, to stay consistent with the spec.** [club_events.md](club_events.md#compliance-soc-2--govramp--privacy) is explicit that P1 ships **manual refunds via the Stripe dashboard** and is exposable in production gated only on the compliance sign-off + operator keys; P2 (automated refunds = our M8) is *deferred* and gated on a **P1 conversion signal**. A conversion signal can only come from P1 being live — so making M8 a hard prerequisite for M9 would deadlock (M9→signal→M8→M9). The honest sequencing: M9 *can* go live on manual refunds the moment M1 is green and sign-off lands, exactly as the spec allows; we **strongly recommend** standing up an operational manual-refund runbook (who refunds, SLA, where it's logged) at go-live and prioritising M8 immediately after, because a manual-only refund path is the biggest reputational risk to a non-technical instructor. Treat "live before M8" as a conscious, signed-off trade, not the default.

### M10 — Mobile register + manage (Track C / club_events P3)
Mobile register via web-checkout handoff (Custom Tab), payout summary read, receipt/refund emails ([email.md](email.md)). Step 10. **Gate to start:** M9 live. **Gate to exit:** mobile read+register, twin parity, no `BYPASS_PAYWALL` override.

**Suggested parallelization:** A (M0→M1) and B (M2→M3→M4) run concurrently. M9 (real money) *can* go live on the spec's manual-refund path once M1 is green and sign-off lands; we **strongly recommend** M8 (automated refunds) lands as fast as possible after, with a manual-refund runbook covering the interim, so we minimise the window in which we hold a stranger's money with only a dashboard refund path (see [M9](#milestone-sequence) and the inline note there). Content (B) can fully ship to free classes regardless of A's legal timeline — a yoga instructor can run a *free* class with a real authored sequence the day M4/M5 land.

## The compliance gate (load-bearing)

Per org policy for SOC 2 / GovRAMP-scoped changes and [club_events.md § Compliance](club_events.md#compliance-soc-2--govramp--privacy): **anything that moves real money (M9, and exposing M1's path in prod) requires owner + CISO + Security Analyst + counsel sign-off before it ships.** Non-negotiable items:

- **PCI:** Stripe-hosted Checkout + onboarding only → stays SAQ A. **Never build a custom card form.**
- **New sub-processor:** Stripe Connect (buyer + host financial/personal data) → sub-processor list + Privacy Policy (`/audit/third-party-data-flows`).
- **DSAR tension:** `event_orders` + `instructor_payout_accounts` enter the GDPR export (Art 20) + deletion (Art 17) paths — but financial/tax/AML retention can override erasure. **Counsel sets the retention term.**
- **GovRAMP:** payment flows are not GovRAMP-scoped and must not process government/regulated data — keep separated.
- **Funds integrity:** webhook is the sole, HMAC-verified, idempotent (on Stripe event id) writer of order status. Already built — verify in M1, don't regress.

Tracks B and C (content, attendance, earnings-read) carry **no** compliance gate — they touch no payments and no new sub-processor. Only the money milestones do.

## Cross-cutting requirements

Every code milestone honours the house rules, so "seamless" doesn't mean "sloppy":

- **Web-first** ([§24](../architecture/decisions.md#24-web-is-the-canonical-feature-surface-mobile-and-watches-are-platform-additive)); **byte-identical mobile twin** ([§39](../architecture/decisions.md#39-mobile_android-and-mobile_ios-share-a-byte-for-byte-dart-codebase)) for any Dart edit.
- **Parity pairs** for every pure helper (fee math, `expandSessionSteps`, `expandRoutineSteps`, `workoutDraftFromSession`); the `shared-library-syncer` agent after each.
- **Narrow union + CHECK lockstep** (`check_constraint_unions.mjs`) for `SessionItemKind` and any new status union.
- **i18n** in every web locale + seven mobile ARBs for every new string (category/discipline already done; content-engine + attendance strings are new).
- **Schema codegen** — both generators after every migration; grow the Dart table list for the new tables ([schema_codegen.md](../architecture/schema_codegen.md)).
- **Layered resilience** — the follow-along runner's TTS/haptics are L4, wrapped per-effect; a cue failure never stops the timer.
- **Test hygiene** — review → unit → e2e per milestone ([conventions.md](../architecture/conventions.md#test-hygiene--review-then-unit-then-e2e)).
- **Category gating is defense-in-depth** — a class stays un-race-able at the data layer, not just hidden (already shipped; don't regress).

## Risks & open questions

1. **The go-live depends on people, not code.** M9 can stall indefinitely on sign-off; that's why Track B is structured to deliver value (free classes, real content) without it.
2. ~~**`gym_sets.duration_s` (M2) touches the gym schema** — decide before M5 (the logging step) so timed holds log cleanly (`session_planner.md` Q1, which phrases it "before P2").~~ **Resolved** — the nullable column landed in `20261231_001` ahead of M5, and both follow-along runners write to it.
3. ~~**Platform fee rate**~~ — decided 2026-10-07: 500 bps on paid events, in the service-role-only `platform_fees` table (decisions § 1768).
4. ~~**Validation gate honesty.** M3/M4 are themselves the probe ("do instructors build content?"); if the signal is flat after M4, freeze Track B at authoring and don't build M5 execution.~~ **Resolved** — the gate was cleared and M5 execution shipped on both platforms.
5. **Attendance model (M6)** — a simple `attended`/`no_show` enum vs a check-in timestamp. Lean enum unless multi-check-in is needed.
6. **Connect account type** — Express (P1 assumption) vs Standard (`club_events.md` Q4).
7. **Is hosting paid events a Pro-host perk?** Ties into the paywall (`club_events.md` Q5).
