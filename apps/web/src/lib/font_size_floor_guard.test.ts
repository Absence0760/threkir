// Source-scan guard for the web half of § 482's micro-label floor.
//
// Mobile pins 11 px as the smallest type any surface may use — `labelSmall` on
// `AppTheme.textTheme`, enumerated by `packages/ui_kit/test/type_scale_test.dart`
// and enforced against hand-written literals by
// `apps/mobile_android/test/font_size_literal_guard_test.dart`. Web had no
// equivalent, and the drift showed: 45 `font-size` declarations sat under it, the
// narrowest at 8 px, and `PlanCalendar`'s `.kind-pill` — on the one plan surface
// every phone user opens — dropped from 0.65rem to 0.55rem (8.8 px) under 40 rem.
// § 525 closed that one and pinned the other 42; the sweep since leaves 9.
//
// This is a FLOOR guard, not mobile's literal guard, and the difference is not
// laziness. Mobile's rule is "name the step", which is enforceable because the
// scale is closed: seven steps on one `textTheme`, so a literal is either a step
// spelled by hand or a value between two steps. Web's CSS carries ~1860 numeric
// `font-size` declarations against three named size tokens, so banning literals
// would need an allowlist longer than the codebase and would assert nothing. What
// transfers is the conformance content of § 482 — the 11 px minimum — and a floor
// says exactly that.
//
// The floor is read out of `app_theme.dart` rather than written here, so the two
// platforms cannot drift the way the line token did before § 518 pinned it.
//
// A pure floor, though, is blind to the population it created. § 525 counted the
// hand-spelled `0.7rem` micro-labels as "the micro-label token 80 declarations
// already use", then recomputed them as 81 literals against 21 token uses. § 536
// re-measured on the current tree: 80 spelled the literal and 49 used the token,
// so neither figure was right. Every one of those 80 sat 0.2 px CLEAR of the
// floor, so no floor could ever see them — and § 522 is the standing warning that
// a value sitting on a floor is where the next regression starts. § 536 routed all
// 80 onto the token and closed the blind spot with a second predicate: the scan
// now fails at or UNDER the token's own value, not merely under the floor. Three
// sites landing on exactly 11.00 px — `BadgeGrid`'s `.badge-tier` and
// `RoutePreviewScrubber`'s `.title` / `.ends`, all real uppercase micro-labels on
// a theme surface — were invisible to the old strict `<` and are now on the token
// too.
//
// When this test fails: reach for `var(--font-size-section-label)` (0.7rem =
// 11.2 px), the micro-label token. Prefer the token over its value — both land on
// 11.2 px today, but only the token moves if the step does.
//
// If a narrow viewport no longer fits the text, tighten the box or let the text
// reflow — SC 1.4.4 and 1.4.10 both ask for reflow rather than a smaller size.
// Never re-shrink it in a media query: that is the defect § 525 found on
// `PlanCalendar` and this round closed on both week ribbons, and a source scan
// cannot see which of a base rule and its override actually paints. The
// resolved-cascade half lives in Playwright — `tests-e2e/plans/calendar.spec.ts`
// and `tests-e2e/cross-cutting/week-strip-type-floor.spec.ts`.
