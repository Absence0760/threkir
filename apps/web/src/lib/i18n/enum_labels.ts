/// `road` was "Asfalto" on the route builder and "Carretera" in the routes
/// filter in Spanish, `going` was "J'y vais" on an event and "Participe" on the
/// club home in French — and half a dozen surfaces skipped the vocabulary
/// entirely and printed the database token, which reads as English in all six
/// locales.
///
/// The value domain is the union declaration in `types.ts`, mirrored here and
/// pinned by `enum_vocabulary.test.ts` — a widened union fails the build until
/// the catalogues catch up. Keys are the value VERBATIM (`clubRole.race_director`,
/// not `clubRole.raceDirector`) so the key is derivable from the stored value
/// with no naming convention in between.
///
/// Registering a union here is what makes it guarded; a union whose values only
/// pick an icon or a CSS class does not belong (nothing names it).
