// Versioned AI-disclosure consent — the gate every endpoint that ships a
// user's data to Anthropic runs before it fans out. GDPR Art 6(1)(a).
//
// The consent record is `user_profiles.ai_disclosure_version` (which
// disclosure was accepted) paired with `coach_consent_at` (when). Neither
// is in the public-safe column grant, so the record is read through the
// SECURITY DEFINER `get_my_profile()` RPC and written only by
// `record_ai_disclosure_consent()` (migration 20270511_001).
//
// Versions are a monotone ladder — each one is a strict superset of the
// last — which is what makes "accepted >= required" sound:
//
//   1  AI Coach only.
//   2  All AI features: the Coach plus the AI route assistant.
//
// Every AI endpoint declares its minimum. Adding the next AI feature means
// a new version with new copy, not a new boolean column and not quietly
// widening what an existing acceptance covers.
//
// This module lives outside `$lib/coach` on purpose: the route-AI handlers
// need it, and importing from the coach barrel drags the Anthropic SDK
// into bundles that have no business carrying it.
