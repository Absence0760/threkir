    // so a checkpoint written by an older build — no `averageBPM` key —
    // still decodes: a synthesised Codable treats an absent key for an
    // Optional as nil, which is exactly the recover-an-in-flight-run-
    // after-app-upgrade path we must not break.

    // Added alongside `averageBPM`: the share of the run's active time the
    // sensor was delivering when the checkpoint was written, so a recovered
    // run states the same thing about its heart rate that a stopped one
    // would. Optional for the same reason, and decoded the same way — a
    // checkpoint from a build predating the field is UNMEASURED, which is
    // what nil means here and everywhere else this figure travels. It must
    // never decode as 0: that would claim the sensor delivered nothing.

    // Added alongside the pre-run activity picker: what the runner chose, so a
    // crash-recovered run is stamped with the activity it was recorded as
    // rather than silently reverting to a run. Stored as the raw token because
    // the checkpoint is a wire format and the column's vocabulary — not this
    // build's enum — is what it has to survive. A checkpoint from a build
    // predating the field decodes as "run", the value the column defaults to.
