// Source-level guard pinning the Art 9 health-data consent gate on the
// /settings/account page. The account page persists date_of_birth into
// user_settings.prefs (read by coach/context.ts). Before this gate it was
// an unguarded second write path that bypassed the consent flow enforced
// on /settings/body. If a future edit removes the gate, DOB starts
// persisting again without explicit consent — a GDPR Art 9 regression.
//
// The gate is on the MIRROR, not on the field. `user_profiles.date_of_birth`
// is the age record behind the under-18 discoverability floor — a
// child-protection purpose written whenever the runner supplies a date
// (decisions § 718). The page used to abort the entire save on
// `dateOfBirth && !healthDataConsent`, which denied a non-consenting minor
// that record and deadlocked every other field on the page behind a DOB
// input the same condition disabled.
