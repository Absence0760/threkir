# Email & notification delivery

The single source of truth for the app's outbound email. For the **in-app**
notification inbox (the bell + Notifications tab) see `decisions.md § 38`; this
doc is the **email** layer that delivers a subset of those notifications plus
transactional / lifecycle mail — and the GoTrue **auth** emails (signup
confirmation, recovery, magic link, email change), which are rendered by the
`auth-email` Edge Function via GoTrue's send-email hook (see § GoTrue auth
emails below).

## Architecture

All product email is sent **server-side by the Go worker**
(`apps/job_worker/`), never from a client; auth email is sent server-side by
the `auth-email` Edge Function (below). These job kinds on the `jobs` queue
drive the worker:

- **`notification_email`** — mirrors a row in the `notifications` table (the
  same row the in-app bell renders). An AFTER-INSERT trigger on `notifications`
  enqueues one job per recipient; the handler gates on the recipient's
  `email_notifications` preference, then sends. `decisions.md § 117`.
- **`lifecycle_email`** — transactional / relationship mail that has **no**
  `notifications` row, keyed by a `template` name (`{user_id, template}`). The
  welcome (signup), the Pro-purchase receipt, and the payment-failed dunning.
  The **account-deletion receipt** (`account_deleted`) reuses this kind but is
  the one inline-address template: its payload carries `{email, locale}` and no
  `user_id` (the user is gone, so the worker can't resolve the address), and it
  dedups on the non-cascading `account_deletion_receipts` table instead of
  `lifecycle_email_log`. `decisions.md § 119` + `§ 121`.
- **`safety_email`** — safety-contact mail. Neither of the above: no
  `notifications` row, and the recipient may be a **non-user identified only by
  an email**, with per-finish context in the copy. Three templates — `confirm`
  (the opt-in request, enqueued by the `safety_contacts` AFTER INSERT trigger),
  `finish` (the finish alert, enqueued for every **confirmed** contact
  **regardless of `is_public`**, with the same 24h recency guard `run_completed`
  uses; since `20270401_001` it fires on the live-stub→saved transition too,
  never on the stub INSERT), and `overdue` (the overdue-runner escalation —
  enqueued once per run by the `enqueue_safety_overdue_emails()` pg_cron scan
  when a live-broadcast run goes silent past the owner's
  `safety_overdue_minutes` window; carries started/last-seen **times + the
  `/live/{run_id}` link, never coordinates**; docs/features/safety.md).
  Crucially **not** gated on the runner's `email_notifications` preference — a
  safety contact opted in explicitly and must not be silenced by the runner's
  social-email setting. `decisions.md § 131`.
- **`weekly_digest`** — the opt-in weekly engagement summary
  (`{user_id}`). Enqueued by a Monday pg_cron over opted-in recipients;
  the handler gates on the opt-IN `email_weekly_digest` pref + the
  `email_suppressions` hard-block + a **third fail-closed gate: a working
  opt-out must exist** — if `WEEKLY_DIGEST_UNSUB_SECRET` is unset the
  computed unsubscribe URL is `""`, and the handler logs an error and skips
  the send rather than emit bulk mail with no `List-Unsubscribe` header and no
  footer opt-out (CAN-SPAM / GDPR-ePrivacy). Only after all three pass does it
  send a bounded localized summary with an RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe.
  `decisions.md § 174`.
- **`lifecycle_drip`** — staged engagement nudges keyed off the user's own
  activity timeline (`{user_id, template}` — `drip_onboarding`,
  `drip_reengagement`, `drip_streak`). The third engagement stream, built on the
  SAME rails as the digest. A daily `enqueue_lifecycle_drip()` pg_cron does ALL
  the cohort selection in SQL (onboarding = account 2–6 days old with no run;
  re-engagement = had a run >30 d ago, no cross-modal activity in 30 d; streak =
  ran the last two days, not yet today), writing the chosen template into the
  payload. The handler gates on a **separate** opt-IN `email_lifecycle_drip`
  pref (default off, never inferred from the digest opt-in) + the same
  `email_suppressions` hard-block + the same **third fail-closed gate** (unset
  `WEEKLY_DIGEST_UNSUB_SECRET` → empty unsubscribe URL → log + skip, no send),
  then renders the fixed per-template copy with an RFC 8058 one-click
  unsubscribe scoped to the drip stream. `decisions.md § 177`.

A **non-email** job kind reuses the same notifications rows over a
different transport:

- **`web_push`** — the browser Web Push channel (migration `20261219_001`). The
  sibling of `notification_email`: an AFTER-INSERT trigger on `notifications`
  enqueues one `web_push` job per recipient **who has a browser subscription**
  (the trigger gates on `user_device_settings.prefs.push_subscription` presence
  to avoid no-op jobs for the push-less majority). The handler
  (`handler_web_push.go`) gates on a **separate** `push_notifications`
  preference (same `all|important|off` shape as `email_notifications`, but
  independent — muting one channel doesn't mute the other), then POSTs an
  encrypted Web Push message (RFC 8291) to each of the user's subscribed
  browsers, signed with the operator's VAPID key (RFC 8292). A dead endpoint
  (404/410) is pruned via the `clear_push_subscription` RPC; a 429/5xx defers.
  `web_push_sent_at` is the per-channel idempotency guard. The crypto is
  stdlib + the worker's existing `golang-jwt` (package `internal/webpush/`) —
  no third-party web-push library.
- **`native_push`** — the locked-phone leg (migration `20270212_001`). The
  THIRD device-delivery sibling: the SAME notifications AFTER-INSERT fan-out, a
  DIFFERENT enqueue trigger (gated on the recipient having an enabled
  `device_tokens` row), the SAME `push_notifications` preference web-push gates on
  (one "push" channel covers browser + native — no separate pref), and a SEPARATE
  `native_push_sent_at` send-state guard. The handler (`handler_native_push.go`)
  fans out over the user's enabled device tokens, routing on
  `device_tokens.platform`: `android` → FCM HTTP v1, `ios` → APNs HTTP/2 (sender
  package `internal/nativepush/`, stdlib + `golang-jwt`, no Firebase Admin SDK).
  A dead token (FCM `UNREGISTERED` 404 / APNs 410) is pruned via
  `clear_device_token`; a 429/5xx defers. Gated on operator-supplied
  Firebase/APNs credentials (below) — unset → jobs finish done, rows stay
  pending. `decisions.md § 161`.

Shared pieces:

- **Transport** — `internal/mailer.go` `SMTPSender` (Mailpit in local dev on
  `127.0.0.1:54325`; a provider's SMTP — Resend / SES — in prod). Sent as
  **multipart/alternative**: a branded, email-client-safe HTML part (table
  layout, inline styles, ≤600 px card, teal header matching app.css
  `--color-primary`, H1, CTA button, footer, inbox preheader) + a plain-text
  fallback. Gated on `SMTP_HOST` — unset → the worker drains the jobs without
  sending (so existing deploys are unaffected).
- **Address** — resolved via the GoTrue admin API (email lives only in
  `auth.users`, not a public table).
- **Localization** — `internal/email_i18n.go` holds a per-locale catalogue for
  all seven app locales (`en/de/fr/es/ja/pt-BR/pt-PT`). The recipient's language
  comes from `user_settings.prefs.locale`, which web + mobile write as a side
  effect of the language picker (`decisions.md § 120`). Unknown/region tags
  normalize to a supported locale; English is the per-key fallback. `<html lang>`
  is set. `TestEmailCatalogueParity` (`email_i18n_test.go`) mirrors the
  web/mobile l10n-parity tests.
  **The locale set is derived, not listed** (`decisions.md § 761`): `emailLocales`
  is `emailCatalogue`'s own keys, because four separate test loops range that
  slice and a locale added to the maps but missed in a hand-written list would be
  skipped by all of them. `TestEmailLocaleSetIsDerivedAndReachable` additionally
  holds `emailSharedByLocale` and `smsCatalogue` to the same set and asserts every
  catalogue is reachable from a tag a client can write — a catalogue nothing
  normalizes to renders for nobody.
  **`normalizeEmailLocale` is one chokepoint for eight handlers** — notification
  email, lifecycle email, lifecycle drip, weekly digest, safety email, safety SMS,
  web push and native push all resolve through it via `localeFromPrefs`. Its
  `emailExact` / `emailBase` tables mirror `EXACT` / `BASE_TO_LOCALE` in
  `apps/web/src/lib/i18n/locale.ts`: `pt-BR` by its own tag, and bare `pt` /
  `pt-AO` / `pt-MZ` / `pt-CV` → `pt-PT`. It used to be `strings.HasPrefix(t,"pt")`
  → `pt-BR`, which handed a Lisbon reader European Portuguese in the browser and
  on the wrist and Brazilian everywhere the worker sends. The one deliberate
  difference from web: the server reads `_` as a separator too, because
  `prefs.locale` is whatever a client wrote, not a negotiated `navigator.language`.
- **Copy coverage** — the catalogue's `"default"` entry ("You have a new
  notification on Threkir." + an "Open Threkir" CTA) exists for a kind a
  *running binary predates* — an older worker draining a queue a newer deploy is
  filling. It is **not** the resting place for a kind we know about. The
  notifications AFTER-INSERT triggers enqueue an email job and a push job for
  **every** kind, with no kind allowlist, so a kind with no catalogue entry ships
  content-free mail to every recipient on `email_notifications='all'`. That went
  unnoticed for `plan_assigned`, `achievement` and `challenge_complete`, because
  the parity test above checks the catalogue against **itself** and cannot see a
  key missing from `en` too. `notification_copy_guard_test.go` closes it: it
  reads the `NotificationKind` union from `apps/web/src/lib/types.ts` (the same
  source the deep-link guard reads) and fails unless each kind has either its own
  copy in every locale or an explicit `inAppOnlyKinds` exemption. It also asserts
  the rendered subject differs from the default, so copy that is present but
  cloned from the fallback fails too.
- **In-app-only kinds** — `mailer.go` `inAppOnlyKinds` never leaves the inbox,
  on any channel, in any mode. `content_hidden` is the only entry: it is a
  *provisional* automated moderation notice (`auto_hide_target`, migration
  `20270218_001`) that a reviewer may reverse within hours, it has no
  destination (web's `notificationLinkFor` returns `null` for it by design, so
  an outbound message would carry a CTA with nowhere to go), and it fires off a
  report count a coordinated reporting campaign can drive — so mailing or
  pushing it hands the campaign a channel the recipient cannot mute per-kind.
  The inbox row still carries the notice, so nothing is withheld. This is
  enforced in `shouldEmail` + `shouldPush`, **not** by omission from
  `importantKinds`: absence there only suppresses the default `important` mode,
  and a recipient on `all` would still be reached.
- **Preference** — `user_settings.prefs.email_notifications` (`all | important
  | off`, default `important`) gates the **notification** channel only;
  transactional/lifecycle mail ignores it (you can't opt out of a receipt).
  Toggle on web `/settings/preferences` + mobile Settings → Preferences.
  Registry: `docs/backend/settings.md`.
- **Per-kind mutes** — `mailer.go` `kindMutePrefKey` maps a notification kind to
  a prefs-bag key that silences it on the OUTBOUND channels (email + both
  pushes), leaving the inbox row alone. One entry today:
  `notify_data_export_ready` for the `data_export_ready` kind
  (`decisions.md § 729`). It exists for kinds where the three-mode channel
  setting is too blunt — muting `email_notifications` to stop one notice also
  stops direct messages. **It can only ever subtract**: `kindMuted` is consulted
  INSIDE `shouldEmail` / `shouldPush` alongside the channel mode, never instead
  of it, so a channel mute still wins and a per-kind `'on'` can never promote a
  kind past one. Both gates take the whole prefs bag rather than a pre-resolved
  mode for exactly this reason — a caller that had to remember a second key
  separately would eventually be a channel that forgot to, and the miss is
  invisible because the mail still sends.
- **Deep links** — `internal/mailer.go` `pathForKind` is the single kind → URL
  map, shared by the email CTA, the web-push payload and the native-push
  message, so a wrong target misroutes all three channels at once. Its inputs
  are ONE `notifications` row's own FK columns — it does no joins, and it is
  pure so the render functions stay testable. Two consequences: anything
  needing a join (an event's club slug, a club's slug) is emitted as a
  **stable-id URL** that web resolves — `/events/[id]` forwards to
  `/clubs/{slug}/events/{id}`, and `/clubs/[slug]` falls back to an id lookup
  and forwards to the canonical slug — and the notification inbox, which is a
  tab rather than a route, is addressed as `/u/{user_id}?tab=notifications`.
  Both id-resolution routes must keep resolving indefinitely: every link the
  worker has ever sent is sitting in an inbox or a notification tray and cannot
  be corrected after the fact. `run_completed` is the one kind whose recipient
  is NOT the row's owner (it fires at a followee's followers), so it links to
  `/share/run/{id}`, which is anon-reachable — an emailed link must open without
  a session, and `/runs/{id}` is behind the layout auth-gate. (Round 10 gave
  `/runs/{id}` a non-owner branch, so it no longer renders "run not found" for a
  public run; that fixed the surface, not the reason this link points at
  `/share`.) Each kind targets the same entity `apps/web`'s `notificationLinkFor`
  does — `/plans/{plan_id}`, `/challenges/{challenge_id}`,
  `/share/badge/{achievement_id}` — which needs `plan_id`, `achievement_id` and
  `challenge_id` in all three `FetchNotificationFor*` projections; a partial
  projection silently degrades one channel to the list-page fallback, since one
  `pathForKind` serves all three renders. Every arm degrades to a list page or
  the inbox when its FK is null. `notification_link_guard_test.go` walks
  `apps/web/src/routes` and fails if any kind — in any FK-presence permutation —
  emits a path that matches no route, and requires an explicit `pathForKind`
  case per kind so a new kind can't inherit the fallback silently;
  `notification_copy_guard_test.go` additionally pins the entity-scoped targets
  against web's table so the two can't drift.
- **Idempotency** — `lifecycle_email_log (user_id, template)` is a send-once
  guard for **once-per-account** templates (welcome only). Recurring
  transactional templates (Pro receipt, dunning) deliberately skip it — the
  enqueue trigger's transition guard is the dedupe. The **account-deletion
  receipt** can't use `lifecycle_email_log` (it FK-cascades away with the
  deleted user), so it dedups on the non-cascading `account_deletion_receipts`
  table keyed by a hash of the address. Delivery is at-least-once.

## GoTrue auth emails (`auth-email` Edge Function)

GoTrue's own transactional emails — signup confirmation, password recovery,
magic link / email OTP, invite, email change, reauthentication — used to be
GoTrue's built-in English-only templates, a separate surface from the localized
worker pipeline above (the 2026-07 i18n-readiness audit's one High finding).
They are now rendered and sent by the `auth-email` Edge Function
(`apps/backend/supabase/functions/auth-email/`), wired in as GoTrue's
**send-email auth hook** (`config.toml [auth.hook.send_email]` locally;
Dashboard → Auth → Hooks in prod):

- **Trust boundary** — GoTrue signs each hook POST per the Standard Webhooks
  spec (`webhook-id` / `webhook-timestamp` / `webhook-signature` over the raw
  body, HMAC-SHA256 keyed by the base64 payload of the `v1,whsec_…` secret in
  `SEND_EMAIL_HOOK_SECRET`; `|`-separated secrets for rotation). The function
  is `verify_jwt = false` (GoTrue sends no Supabase JWT), so the signature
  check is the entire gate and it fails closed: missing secret → 503, missing
  or invalid signature / >5-min-stale timestamp → 401, 64 KB body cap.
  Hook-supplied recipients (`user.email` / `user.new_email`) pass
  `isValidRecipient` before reaching the MIME `To:` header or the SMTP
  `RCPT TO` command (no control chars / brackets / delimiters, single `@`,
  RFC 5321 length cap — header/command-injection defence in depth on top of
  GoTrue's own format validation); an invalid recipient is a 400
  `invalid_recipient`, never a silent skip, and `smtpSend` re-checks at the
  wire as a last-line guard. Pinned by `lib.test.ts` + `handler.test.ts`
  (45 deno tests) and four cases in `_shared/handler_envelope.test.ts` —
  three refusals plus, since [decisions § 1100](../architecture/decisions.md),
  the positive path: a correctly signed signup hook delivered into the local
  Mailpit, asserted on the localized subject and on this run's own
  `token_hash`. The CI boot step writes `SMTP_HOST=host.docker.internal` /
  `SMTP_PORT=54325` / `SMTP_FROM` for it; `127.0.0.1` there would be the
  functions container's own loopback.
- **Locale** — `user_settings.prefs.locale` (service-role read, the same
  §120 pref the worker uses) → signup-time `user_metadata.locale` → `en`. The
  settings read is auxiliary: if it fails the mail still goes out in the
  fallback locale, never blocks the auth flow. The catalogue covers the same
  seven locales as `email_i18n.go` (`en/de/fr/es/ja/pt-BR/pt-PT`), the same
  normalization (exact tag, then base language, unknown → `en`; `pt-BR` by its
  own tag and bare `pt` / `pt-AO` / `pt-MZ` / `pt-CV` → `pt-PT`), and the
  HTML/text layout is a port of the worker's renderer so auth mail is visually
  identical to product mail. `AUTH_EMAIL_LOCALES` is derived from
  `authEmailCatalogue`'s keys; the parity test compares `authEmailShared`'s key
  set against it and probes the normalizer in both directions
  (`decisions.md § 761`).
- **Actions** — one catalogue entry per `email_action_type`: `signup`,
  `invite`, `magiclink`, `recovery` (+ `email` OTP reusing the magic-link
  copy), `email_change` (a secure email change sends TWO mails from one hook
  invocation — the current address pairs `token` + `token_hash_new`, the new
  address `token_new` + `token_hash`; the field names are reversed upstream
  for backwards compatibility), `reauthentication` (code-only, no link), and
  `password_changed_notification`. Unknown/future action types fall through
  to an informational default and never fail the hook — a hook failure
  surfaces as a GoTrue API error to the user mid-signup/reset.
- **Action link** — for an http(s) landing (every web flow) the link points
  straight at that landing carrying the hash the page redeems:
  `{redirect_to}?token_hash={token_hash}&type={action}`. `verifyOtp` mints the
  session from the hash alone, so it works in whatever browser opened the
  mail. The GoTrue `{base}/auth/v1/verify?token=…&type=…&redirect_to=…` hop —
  byte-compatible with GoTrue's own, including the
  leave-unencoded-unless-`&=#` redirect quirk — is kept only for a
  non-http(s) target (the mobile `com.threkir.app://` deep link, where the
  flow starts and finishes in one app that holds its PKCE verifier, and
  `supabase_flutter` only understands the resulting `?code=`) and for a
  missing `redirect_to`. See `decisions.md § 1616` and
  `docs/features/web_app_auth.md § Email confirmation redirect`. The OTP
  code rides along as the link alternative. The verify-hop base is
  `API_EXTERNAL_URL`
  when set, else the runtime-injected `SUPABASE_URL`: the local stack injects
  the Docker-internal `http://kong:8000` as `SUPABASE_URL`, which no browser
  resolves (CI run 28707481878 broke every reset-password e2e this way), so
  the committed `supabase/functions/.env` pins `API_EXTERNAL_URL` to
  `http://127.0.0.1:54321`. Prod leaves it unset — the hosted runtime's
  `SUPABASE_URL` is already the public project URL. (The name mirrors
  GoTrue's `api_external_url`; a `SUPABASE_`-prefixed name can't be used —
  the CLI reserves the prefix and drops such vars from env files.)
- **Transport** — the same SMTP env contract as the worker (`SMTP_HOST/PORT/
  USERNAME/PASSWORD/FROM`): a minimal Deno SMTP client (`smtp.ts` — implicit
  TLS on 465, opportunistic STARTTLS otherwise, AUTH PLAIN when credentials
  are set), multipart/alternative with RFC 2047 subjects. Unset SMTP → 503
  (fail-closed; GoTrue reports the send failure rather than silently
  dropping).
- **Local wiring** — `config.toml [auth.hook.send_email]` carries a committed
  local-dev secret (an `env()` reference would break `supabase start` on any
  machine without the var exported), mirrored in the committed
  `supabase/functions/.env`, which the CLI auto-loads into the local edge
  runtime on `supabase start` — so signup/recovery mail lands in Mailpit
  localized with zero setup. `.env.development` carries the same values for
  a manual `supabase functions serve --env-file` run.
- **Prod deploy** — the function ships with the normal `deploy-functions` CI
  job, but the hook itself must be configured on the hosted project: generate
  a secret in Dashboard → Auth → Hooks (send email hook, HTTPS, pointed at
  the deployed function URL), and set the SAME value as the function secret
  (`supabase secrets set SEND_EMAIL_HOOK_SECRET=v1,whsec_…`) along with the
  `SMTP_*` vars (the worker's provider credentials work as-is). Until the
  hook is enabled there, prod keeps GoTrue's built-in templates — enabling it
  is a pre-launch ops checklist item (see § Production ops).
- **Manual verification** (one step, after any config.toml change): restart
  the local stack (`cd apps/backend && supabase stop && supabase start`),
  trigger a mail-sending auth flow from the web app (e.g. `/login?reset=1` →
  send reset link for `runner@test.com`), and check Mailpit at
  `http://127.0.0.1:54324` for the branded, localized message whose verify
  link round-trips.

## Planned / not built

- [~] **Weekly digest** (engagement) — code complete, send gated; the open half is **Email — production ops** in [`roadmap.md`](../product/roadmap.md). **FULLY BUILT INCL. SCHEDULER, SEND STILL GATED
  ON SMTP + CISO/COUNSEL (2026-06-20, scheduler migration `20270220_001`; decisions §174).**
  The missing piece — a `pg_cron` `enqueue_weekly_digests()` (Monday 08:00 UTC,
  opt-in-only, dedupe-safe) — now ships; the send is fail-closed on the unset
  SMTP credential (jobs drain to `done` without `SMTP_HOST`). The one-click
  `List-Unsubscribe-Post` header is digest-only. Foundation (2026-06-12, migration `20270108_001`): the `weekly_digest`
  jobs.kind, the `email_suppressions` hard-block table (fail-closed RLS,
  worker-only), the **opt-IN** `email_weekly_digest` pref (default `off`,
  separate key — never folded into `email_notifications`), and a **stateless
  keyed-HMAC RFC 8058 unsubscribe token** (non-guessable, no PII, no token
  table). Worker backend now built **behind the gate**: the `weekly_digest`
  handler (`handler_weekly_digest.go` — gates on the opt-in pref, hard-blocks
  on `email_suppressions`, builds a bounded weekly mileage/PB/kudos summary,
  renders localized HTML+text with a `List-Unsubscribe` header + footer token),
  the per-recipient digest **builder** (`EnqueueAllWeeklyDigests` in
  `digest_builder.go` — selects opted-in recipients, enqueues one job each),
  and the unauth one-click **unsubscribe endpoint** (`internal/unsubscribe/` →
  `/unsubscribe/weekly-digest`, verifies the HMAC, flips the pref off + inserts
  a suppression row, fail-closed on a bad/missing token; keyed by
  `WEEKLY_DIGEST_UNSUB_SECRET`). The **reverse path** — a user re-opting into a
  stream via Settings (a pref flips off→on) — calls the SECURITY DEFINER
  `clear_my_unsubscribe_suppression()` RPC (migration `20270425_001`), which
  deletes the caller's OWN `reason='unsubscribe'` suppression only (never a
  `bounce`/`complaint`/`manual` row), scoped to the caller's own address via
  `auth.uid()`. Without it the address-keyed hard-block outlived the pref and
  silently dropped every future send while the toggle read 'on' (#392); the
  address-keyed row covers every stream, so re-opting into either engagement
  stream lifts it and the per-stream opt-in prefs become the authoritative gate
  again. The Go builder
  `digest_builder.go` (`EnqueueAllWeeklyDigests`) stays the manual backfill path
  and is deliberately unscheduled; the scheduled producer is the SQL
  `enqueue_weekly_digests()` that `20270220_001` puts on `pg_cron`. The **opt-in
  preference toggle** ships on web `/settings/preferences` + mobile Settings →
  Preferences (default off). The **provider bounce/complaint suppression
  webhook** is now built (`POST /v1/email/bounce`, worker
  `internal/bouncehook/` — parses Resend event JSON / SES-over-SNS
  notifications, writes a `bounce`/`complaint` row to `email_suppressions` per
  affected address, soft bounces are a no-op; shared-secret authed +
  rate-limited like the Strava hook, gated on `EMAIL_BOUNCE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
  unset → 503). Enabling an actual send (wiring the builder's `pg_cron`) is
  **gated on CISO + counsel sign-off** (bulk/promotional mail under CAN-SPAM +
  GDPR/ePrivacy, unlike the transactional kinds) — the only remaining work for
  an enabled send is that operator-side `pg_cron` schedule + the sign-off.
- [~] **Lifecycle drip** (engagement) — code complete, send gated; the open half is **Email — production ops** in [`roadmap.md`](../product/roadmap.md). **FULLY BUILT INCL. SCHEDULER, SEND STILL
  GATED ON SMTP + CISO/COUNSEL (2026-06-20, migration `20270223_001`; decisions
  §177).** Onboarding / re-engagement / streak nudges on the SAME rails as the
  weekly digest — a new `lifecycle_drip` jobs.kind carrying `{user_id, template}`
  (`drip_onboarding`, `drip_reengagement`, `drip_streak`). A daily
  `enqueue_lifecycle_drip()` pg_cron (09:00 UTC) does ALL the cohort selection in
  SQL — onboarding = opted-in account 2–6 days old with no run yet;
  first-week = 1–2 runs total with the latest 2–5 days ago (the habit-formation
  lapse window between onboarding and re-engagement); re-engagement = had a run
  >30 d ago but no cross-modal `activities` row in 30 d; streak = ran the last
  two calendar days but not yet today — writing the chosen template into the
  payload, dedupe-safe per `(user_id, template)`. **Dedupe includes `done` for
  onboarding + first-week + re-engagement** (migration `20270331_001` for
  first-week, `20270423_001` back-porting it to onboarding + re-engagement, issue
  #376) so the daily cron cannot re-send a completed nudge: onboarding is strictly
  one-shot (jobs retention 30 d ≫ its 4-day window), re-engagement re-fires only
  after its `done` row is pruned (~monthly win-back, not the old daily-forever
  loop). Streak deliberately keeps the `('queued','running')`-only dedupe — a
  streak is at risk every day, so its nudge is meant to re-fire daily while the
  streak lives. The worker
  handler (`handler_lifecycle_drip.go`) gates on a **separate** opt-IN
  `email_lifecycle_drip` pref (default off — NEVER folded into the digest opt-in;
  opting into one engagement stream is not consent to the other) + the shared
  `email_suppressions` hard-block, then renders the fixed per-template localized
  copy with an RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe at `/unsubscribe/lifecycle-drip`.
  The unsubscribe endpoint + the stateless HMAC token are now **stream-aware**
  (one mechanism, one `WEEKLY_DIGEST_UNSUB_SECRET`, the token scope namespaces
  the streams so one stream's link can't unsubscribe another); a suppression row
  blocks every stream to that address. **Fail-closed on the unset SMTP
  credential** (jobs drain to `done` without `SMTP_HOST`); enabling an actual
  send is the operator's SMTP provisioning + the CISO/counsel sign-off (the cron
  is harmless no-op churn until then). The **opt-in preference toggle** ships on
  web Settings → Preferences (`email-lifecycle-drip` checkbox) + mobile
  Settings → Preferences (`prefsEmailLifecycleDrip` switch, default off),
  i18n'd across every web locale + every ARB — the in-app equivalent of the one-click
  unsubscribe, mirroring the digest toggle.
- [x] **Account-deletion receipt** — SHIPPED 2026-06-20 (migration
  `20270217_001`, `account_deleted` template). Built as **enqueue-with-inline-
  address + a non-cascading send-once record** (not inline-send-from-EF — that
  would mean a second SMTP transport + a duplicate i18n catalogue in Deno).
  The `delete-account` EF captures `user.email` + the locale BEFORE the
  cascade, then AFTER `admin.deleteUser` succeeds enqueues a `lifecycle_email`
  job whose payload carries `{template, email, locale}` and **no `user_id`** —
  so the EF's `payload->>user_id` job-drain leaves it untouched (no drain-exempt
  special-casing needed). The worker's `handleLifecycleEmail` dispatches the
  inline-address template to `handleAccountDeletionReceipt`, which dedups on a
  SHA-256 hash of the address via the non-cascading `account_deletion_receipts`
  table (`lifecycle_email_log` would have cascaded away with the user). The
  receipt copy carries no `/settings/preferences` link (the account is gone).
  Because the EF holds no catalogue of its own, `normalizeReceiptLocale` can
  name a locale the worker has no `account_deleted` copy for and the receipt
  would silently arrive in English. `lib.test.ts` therefore parses the worker's
  `emailCatalogue` out of the Go source and holds `RECEIPT_LOCALES` to it — the
  only cross-tier locale guard in the repo (`decisions.md § 761`).
  The deleted address lingers in `jobs.payload` only until the job drains
  (minutes), then in `account_deletion_receipts` only as a hash, pruned at 30
  days. `decisions.md § 121`.
- [x] **Web push server-side delivery** — SHIPPED 2026-06-04 (migration
  `20261219_001`, `web_push` kind). See the architecture note above. Gated on the
  operator-generated `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`/`VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` (self-generated, not a
  third-party credential); unset → jobs finish done, rows stay pending. The
  `push_notifications` category toggle ships on both platforms
  (`settings/preferences/+page.svelte`, `settings_preferences_screen.dart`);
  gating works on the `important` default without it.
- [~] **Native push (FCM / APNs)** — code complete, send gated; the open half is **Native push delivery** in [`followups.md`](../product/followups.md). Backend + client BUILT 2026-06-19 (migration
  `20270212_001`, `native_push` kind), **send gated on operator credentials**. Same
  `notifications` source of truth + sibling-consumer pattern the `web_push` kind
  demonstrates; the FCM/APNs sender (`internal/nativepush/`) + handler
  (`handler_native_push.go`) + the mobile `firebase_messaging` device-token
  registration (`push_messaging_bridge.dart`, both twins) all ship. Going live is
  blocked only on operator-supplied Firebase/APNs credentials on the worker
  (`FCM_*` / `APNS_*`) + the per-app config files (`google-services.json` /
  `GoogleService-Info.plist`); unset → jobs finish done, rows stay pending. roadmap
  Phase 4b. See the architecture sibling note above + `decisions.md § 161`.

- [x] **Data-export-ready notification** — SHIPPED 2026-08-25 (migration
  `20270607_001`, `data_export_ready` notification kind; `decisions.md § 729`).
  This was the longest-standing **Not planned** entry in this doc, on a
  precondition that has since expired: "the export endpoint is synchronous and
  returns a 10-minute signed URL inline, so an async email would arrive stale."
  The export is a queued job since `§ 717` and the only rail on either client
  since `§ 724`. The staleness objection is answered by the same design that
  closed it rather than waived: the signed URL is minted when the subject asks
  (web's status endpoint at read time, mobile at the Download tap), never when
  the worker finishes, so the message links to **`/settings/account`** and
  carries no URL and no expiry of its own. It is ONE `notifications` row, so all
  three existing transports pick it up as siblings; the idempotency stamp is
  `data_export_jobs.notified_at`, written in the same statement as the inbox row
  by `notify_data_export_ready()`, which makes an at-least-once redelivery
  silent AND lets the already-built branch re-ask (repairing a crash between the
  finish write and the announcement). A failed announcement never fails the
  export. The **opt-OUT** `notify_data_export_ready` pref is the per-kind mute
  (default on, web Settings → Preferences), deliberately the opposite direction
  from the engagement streams' opt-IN — see `docs/backend/settings.md` and the
  ADR for why. Goes live with the shared `SMTP_HOST` worker gate like every
  other notification kind; no new credential.

- [x] **Reversed-refund notification** — SHIPPED 2026-08-31 (migration
  `20270701000001`, `refund_failed` notification kind; `decisions.md § 825`).
  A refund the bank sent back leaves money with us that we owe the payer, and
  `decisions.md § 789` gave that state an honest name and an operator worklist
  but no reader — the buyer's seat was gone, the refund never arrived, and
  nothing said why. This is the sentence the app should be saying.
  A **notification kind rather than a `jobs.kind`**, for two reasons that are
  both about reach: the fan-out already turns one row into the inbox entry, the
  email and both pushes, and the inbox is the **only one of those four mobile
  renders** (there is no paid-registration surface on mobile at all —
  `club_events.md` P3); and on the **donation** ledger it is the only surface
  that can exist, because `donations` carries no client SELECT policy and a
  donor cannot read their own row anywhere, so the message carries the whole
  sentence rather than pointing at a ledger they cannot see.
  In `importantKinds`, so the default `important` mode delivers it. It gets
  **no `kindMutePrefKey` entry** — a per-kind opt-out of being told we still
  hold your money is not a control anyone benefits from having, and
  `email_notifications = off` still silences it, which is the fail-closed
  property that matters. There is no `notified_at` stamp either: the enqueue
  trigger is `after update of status ... when (old.status is distinct from
  new.status)`, and the webhook CASes against the status it read, so a
  redelivery updates no row and announces nothing — the § Idempotency rule for
  recurring transactional templates, not the once-per-account one.
  `pathForKind` has **two arms**: an event order carries `event_id` and goes to
  `/events/{id}`, a donation carries no FK and goes to the inbox, because
  `eventPath`'s own `/clubs` fallback would answer "we still have your money"
  with a club directory. An **anonymous** donation (`donor_user_id` null) has
  no account to reach and is skipped in the trigger. Goes live with the shared
  `SMTP_HOST` worker gate; no new credential.

### Not planned (with reason)

- **New-device sign-in alerts** — there's no sign-in/device tracking to key
  them off. The send-email hook IS now configured (§ GoTrue auth emails) and
  its catalogue already carries `password_changed_notification` copy, so if
  GoTrue's security-notification sends are ever enabled they arrive localized
  — but we don't enable them today.

## Production ops (required before any email actually sends)

None of this sends in prod until an operator:

1. **Provisions SMTP** on the worker — `SMTP_HOST/PORT/USERNAME/PASSWORD/FROM`
   + `APP_BASE_URL` (Resend or SES). Until then `notification_email` /
   `lifecycle_email` jobs finish without sending.
2. **Confirms the pg_cron schedules** are live in the deployed Supabase
   (`enqueue-event-reminders`, `enqueue-weekly-digest`, `enqueue-lifecycle-drip`).
   The two engagement crons (`enqueue-weekly-digest`, `enqueue-lifecycle-drip`)
   enqueue harmless no-op jobs until SMTP is provisioned — the send leg is the
   gate, not the schedule.
2b. (For **web push**) sets `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` (the same key the browser
   subscribed with — apps/web's `PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`), `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`,
   and `VAPID_SUBJECT` (`mailto:` contact) on the worker. Until then `web_push`
   jobs finish done while leaving the notification rows pending.
2c. (For **native push**) provisions a Firebase project + an APNs auth key, then:
   on the **worker**, sets `FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` + `FCM_PROJECT_ID` (Android)
   and/or `APNS_KEY_P8` + `APNS_KEY_ID` + `APNS_TEAM_ID` + `APNS_TOPIC`
   (+ `APNS_SANDBOX=1` for dev builds) (iOS); on the **mobile apps**, drops
   `google-services.json` into `apps/mobile_android/android/` and
   `GoogleService-Info.plist` into
   `apps/mobile_ios/ios/`. Either credential group alone enables that platform;
   neither set → `native_push` jobs finish done while leaving the rows pending,
   and the mobile bridge no-ops (compiles + runs without the config files). A
   configured-but-invalid credential fails the worker loudly at startup.
2d. (For **auth emails**) prod auth mail has three independent knobs — the
   **sender** (SMTP), the **templates** (the send-email hook), and the **URL
   config**. Provider is **Resend, already wired**: the DKIM/SPF/DMARC for
   `threkir.com` are Terraformed in `infra/dns` (the same identity the Go
   worker's transactional mail already uses), so there is **no new provider or
   DNS work** — reuse it.
   - **Sender — essential; fixes the `noreply@mail.app.supabase.io` From.**
     Set project custom SMTP → Resend (Dashboard → Auth → Emails → SMTP, or the
     Management API `config/auth` `smtp_*` fields): host `smtp.resend.com`, port
     `587`, **username the literal `resend`** (not the key), password = a
     sending-scoped Resend API key (`re_…`, ideally a dedicated `supabase-auth`
     key, not the worker's), sender email `noreply@threkir.com`, name `Threkir`.
     Until this is set, all auth mail arrives from GoTrue's shared
     `noreply@mail.app.supabase.io`. This alone gives a correct sender +
     working (English, unbranded) emails.
   - **Templates — optional, currently deferred → English built-ins.** Enable
     the send-email hook (Dashboard → Auth → Hooks → Send Email) pointed at the
     deployed `auth-email` function URL with a generated `v1,whsec_…` secret,
     plus `supabase secrets set SEND_EMAIL_HOOK_SECRET=… SMTP_HOST=smtp.resend.com
     SMTP_PORT=587 SMTP_USERNAME=resend SMTP_PASSWORD=<re_…>
     SMTP_FROM='Threkir <noreply@threkir.com>'` on the function. **Deploy
     `auth-email` to prod BEFORE enabling the hook** — an enabled hook pointed
     at an absent function 404s every auth email. When the hook is off, GoTrue
     uses its built-in English templates sent via the project custom SMTP above.
     Tracked in followups.md.
   - **URL config.** The Site URL defaults to `http://localhost:3000`. Web +
     mobile signup and reset now pass an explicit redirect (`/auth/callback`,
     the `com.threkir.app://login-callback` deep link, `/auth/reset`), but
     GoTrue only honours a redirect that is on the allow-list and otherwise
     falls back to the Site URL — so set Site URL to `https://threkir.com` and
     add `/auth/callback`, `/auth/reset`, and `com.threkir.app://login-callback`
     to **Auth → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs**, or confirmations land on
     localhost. **Confirm email** (Auth → Providers → Email) is off on a fresh
     project *and* in local `config.toml`, so the signup-confirmation path is
     prod-only — see web_app_auth.md § Email confirmation redirect.
3. **Sets up domain auth** — SPF / DKIM / DMARC for `threkir.com` so mail isn't
   spam-filed. **Already done for Resend** — the record set is Terraformed in
   `infra/dns` (`email_auth_records`), so a DR rebuild restores deliverability;
   auth mail (2d) reuses the same verified identity.
4. (Before any **bulk/engagement** mail — the weekly digest AND the lifecycle
   drip) the RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe endpoints (set
   `WEEKLY_DIGEST_UNSUB_SECRET` — the one shared secret keys both
   `/unsubscribe/weekly-digest` and `/unsubscribe/lifecycle-drip`) + the
   bounce/complaint suppression webhook (set `EMAIL_BOUNCE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`,
   ≥32 chars, and point the provider's bounce/complaint webhook at
   `POST /v1/email/bounce?secret=…`). Both are built behind their secrets;
   unset → the endpoints return 503.
5. (For the **lifecycle drip** + **weekly digest** specifically) **CISO +
   counsel sign-off** — bulk/promotional mail under CAN-SPAM + GDPR/ePrivacy,
   unlike the transactional kinds. This is a pre-deploy checklist item; the
   code path is built and fail-closed (SMTP unset → nothing sends, and even
   with SMTP every recipient is hard-gated on the per-stream opt-IN pref + the
   suppression block).
6. (For the **sender brand logo**, BIMI — issue #211) so inbox clients render
   the Threkir mark next to `noreply@threkir.com` instead of a generic letter
   avatar. See § Sender brand logo (BIMI) below for the two fail-closed gates.

## Sender brand logo (BIMI)

Mail from `noreply@threkir.com` (both the Go worker's product mail and the
`auth-email` GoTrue leg) shows a generic letter avatar in inboxes because the
domain publishes no [BIMI](https://bimigroup.org/) record. BIMI (Brand
Indicators for Message Identification) is a display-only DNS hint: a `TXT`
record at `default._bimi.threkir.com` points at a hosted SVG logo, and a
conforming inbox renders it beside authenticated mail.

The code side is built and committed:

- **Logo asset** — `apps/web/static/bimi-logo.svg`, served at
  `https://threkir.com/bimi-logo.svg` off the apex CloudFront distribution.
  It conforms to the **SVG Tiny 1.2 Portable/Secure (SVG P/S)** profile BIMI
  requires: `version="1.2"` + `baseProfile="tiny-ps"`, a `<title>`, a square
  `viewBox`, a solid (non-transparent) background, and no scripts / external
  references / animation. It reuses the brand mark from `logo-mark.svg`; if a
  dedicated brand-approved BIMI SVG is later produced it should replace this
  file at the same path (the DNS record is unaffected).
- **DNS record** — the `bimi` entry in `infra/dns/terraform.tfvars`
  (`email_auth_records`), Terraformed alongside the SPF/DKIM/DMARC set so a DR
  rebuild restores it: `v=BIMI1; l=https://threkir.com/bimi-logo.svg;`.

**Two fail-closed prerequisites gate an actual logo render — neither is code:**

1. **DMARC at enforcement — CURRENTLY A BLOCKER.** BIMI requires the domain's
   DMARC policy to be at enforcement (`p=quarantine` or `p=reject`) and **not**
   `sp=none`. The Terraformed `_dmarc.threkir.com` record is still
   **`v=DMARC1; p=none;`** (its inline note plans a tighten to `p=quarantine`
   once Resend + Migadu have authenticated for 48h+). Until DMARC is raised,
   **no mailbox provider will honour the BIMI record** — the logo will not
   appear regardless of the record or the VMC. This is left at `p=none`
   deliberately: raising DMARC enforcement can bounce/quarantine legitimate
   mail if SPF/DKIM alignment isn't already passing for every sender on the
   domain, so it must be a deliberate, monitored change (watch aggregate/`rua`
   reports first), not a side effect of shipping BIMI. **Do not flip it to
   `p=quarantine`/`p=reject` until alignment is confirmed passing.**
2. **Verified Mark Certificate (VMC) — paid, deploy-gate.** Gmail and other
   VMC-requiring inboxes additionally need a paid VMC (a trademark-backed
   certificate from a BIMI-authorized CA, e.g. Entrust/DigiCert; requires a
   registered trademark on the logo). The `a=` field of the BIMI record is left
   **unset** until the VMC PEM is purchased and hosted — then it's appended:
   `… l=…; a=https://threkir.com/bimi-vmc.pem;`. With `a=` unset, the logo still
   renders in clients that don't demand a VMC; Gmail lights up only once `a=`
   is filled. This is fail-closed by construction — record the VMC purchase +
   `a=` fill as a pre-deploy checklist item, not a "blocked" stub.

## Where the code lives

- Worker: `apps/job_worker/internal/` — `mailer.go` (transport + HTML/text
  render incl. `renderWeeklyDigest`; also `importantKinds` / `inAppOnlyKinds` /
  `kindMutePrefKey` + `pathForKind`), `email_i18n.go` (catalogue),
  `handler_notification_email.go`, `handler_lifecycle_email.go`,
  `handler_safety_email.go`. Data-export-ready: the announcement hook is
  `handler_data_export.go`'s `announceExportReady` over
  `SupabaseClient.NotifyDataExportReady` (`supabase_dataexport_jobs.go`) — it
  runs on BOTH the fresh-build path and the already-built early return, and
  never returns an error. Web push: `handler_web_push.go`, `push_render.go`
  (pref gate + payload), and the `internal/webpush/` RFC 8291/8292 sender.
  Native push: `handler_native_push.go` (reuses `push_render.go`'s `pushMode` /
  `shouldPush` pref gate + the shared title/body catalogue), and the
  `internal/nativepush/` FCM HTTP v1 + APNs HTTP/2 sender (stdlib + `golang-jwt`).
  Weekly digest (behind the gate): `handler_weekly_digest.go` (gate + render),
  `digest_builder.go` (`EnqueueAllWeeklyDigests` — UNSCHEDULED),
  `internal/digesttoken/` (the stateless RFC 8058 HMAC token, now **stream-aware**:
  `Mint(secret, stream, userID)` / `Verify(...)` over the `weekly_digest` /
  `lifecycle_drip` scopes), `internal/unsubscribe/` (the unauth endpoint, now
  **stream-aware** — mounts `/unsubscribe/weekly-digest` AND
  `/unsubscribe/lifecycle-drip` off one shared secret), and `internal/bouncehook/`
  (the provider bounce/complaint webhook at `POST /v1/email/bounce` that writes
  `bounce`/`complaint` suppression rows). Lifecycle drip (behind the same gate):
  `handler_lifecycle_drip.go` (the digest's sibling — opt-in `email_lifecycle_drip`
  + suppression gate, per-template render via `renderLifecycleDrip` in `mailer.go`;
  cohort selection is in SQL, not the handler).
- Migrations: `20261130_001` (notification channel + reminders), `20261202_001`
  (welcome), `20261203_001` (subscription emails), `20261218_001` (safety
  contacts + the `safety_email` kind), `20261219_001` (web-push channel + the
  `web_push` kind + `clear_push_subscription`), `20270108_001` (weekly-digest
  foundation — `weekly_digest` kind + `email_suppressions` + the opt-in pref +
  the stateless-HMAC unsubscribe design), `20270212_001` (native-push channel —
  `native_push` kind + `native_push_sent_at` + the device-token-gated enqueue
  trigger + `clear_device_token`), `20270217_001` (account-deletion receipt — the
  non-cascading `account_deletion_receipts` send-once table; the `account_deleted`
  template rides the existing `lifecycle_email` kind, so no jobs.kind CHECK change),
  `20270220_001` (weekly-digest scheduler — the `enqueue-weekly-digest` pg_cron),
  `20270223_001` (lifecycle drip — the `lifecycle_drip` jobs.kind + the
  `enqueue_lifecycle_drip()` cohort-selection function + the daily
  `enqueue-lifecycle-drip` pg_cron; the opt-in `email_lifecycle_drip` pref is a
  jsonb key with no migration, like the digest pref), `20270607_001`
  (data-export-ready — the `data_export_ready` notifications kind, widened with
  the `NOT VALID` + `VALIDATE` two-step because `notifications` is a guarded
  table, plus `data_export_jobs.notified_at` and the `notify_data_export_ready()`
  service-role RPC; the opt-OUT `notify_data_export_ready` pref is a jsonb key
  with no migration), `20270701000001` (reversed refund — the `refund_failed`
  notifications kind on the same two-step, plus one `after update of status`
  trigger per money ledger; no stamp column and no pref, decisions § 825).
- Native-push client leg: the mobile device-token registration —
  `apps/mobile_android/lib/push_messaging_bridge.dart` +
  `firebase_push_messaging.dart` (byte-identical iOS twins), wired in `main.dart`,
  with the `device_tokens` upsert/enable/remove methods on `packages/api_client`.
  The `device_tokens` table (platform-checked rows, the `is_notifications_enabled`
  per-device flag, owner-scoped RLS) shipped in migration `20260506_001`.
- Web push client leg: `apps/web/src/lib/util/push.ts` (subscribe/unsubscribe) +
  `apps/web/static/sw.js` (service worker render). The subscription lives on
  `user_device_settings.prefs.push_subscription` — `docs/backend/settings.md`.
- Safety contacts: web Settings → Safety (`apps/web/src/routes/settings/safety/`)
  + the logged-out email-link confirm page (`apps/web/src/routes/safety/confirm/`);
  mobile Settings → Safety contacts (`apps/mobile_android/lib/screens/settings_safety_screen.dart`,
  byte-identical iOS twin) add/confirm/remove + incoming-request confirm/decline;
  schema in `docs/backend/api_database.md`. The email-link confirm page stays
  web-only (no mobile deep-link route).
- Clients (locale write): web `apps/web/src/routes/settings/preferences/`,
  mobile `apps/mobile_android/lib/screens/settings_preferences_screen.dart`.
- Auth emails: `apps/backend/supabase/functions/auth-email/` — `lib.ts`
  (Standard Webhooks verification + the six-locale catalogue + send plan +
  render + MIME), `smtp.ts` (Deno SMTP client), `handler.ts` (the injectable
  request path), `index.ts` (env + service-role locale lookup wiring); hook
  config in `apps/backend/supabase/config.toml [auth.hook.send_email]` +
  the committed `supabase/functions/.env`.
- ADRs: `decisions.md` §117 (channel), §119 (lifecycle kind), §120 (i18n),
  §121 (subscription emails), §131 (safety-contact alerts), §203 (auth-email
  hook), §729 (data-export-ready + the per-kind mute), §825 (reversed refund).
