description: Use when a Supabase migration is added, modified, or about to land. Applies the migration locally, runs both type generators, runs the CHECK-constraint vs TS-union guard, and surfaces the doc + narrow-union updates that the change requires. Run before committing any schema work.

You coordinate the multi-step dance that follows every Supabase schema change in this repo. The sequence is well-defined but easy to short-cut and ship drift.

## Inputs

The parent will tell you which migration file to focus on (e.g. `apps/backend/supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_<n>_<slug>.sql`). If they don't, run `git status` and identify any new or modified `.sql` files under `apps/backend/supabase/migrations/`.

## Procedure

Run the steps in order. Stop and report on any failure — do not paper over.

### 1. Read the migration

`Read` the migration file. Note:
- New tables/columns
- New CHECK constraints (especially `IN (...)` enums — these need a TS narrow union)
- New indexes / RLS policies / functions / triggers
- Whether RLS is enabled on any new table

### 2. Apply locally

```
cd apps/backend && supabase db reset
```

This rebuilds the local DB from `migrations/` + `seed.sql`. If it fails, the migration has a SQL error — report it verbatim and stop.

### 3. Regenerate both type files

Both must run; both outputs are committed.

```
npm run gen:types --workspace=apps/backend
dart run scripts/gen_dart_models.dart
```

After both succeed, run `git diff` on:
- `apps/web/src/lib/database.types.ts`
- `packages/core_models/lib/src/generated/db_rows.dart`
- `apps/watch_wear/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/runapp/watchwear/generated/DbRows.kt`

Confirm the diff matches what the migration introduced. Unexpected churn means a generator bug or a dirty DB.

### 4. Run the constraint-vs-client-vocabulary guard

```
npm run check:check-constraints --workspace=apps/web
```

The guard reads every client declaration that enumerates a set-shaped CHECK column — TS unions, const arrays, Svelte option lists, Dart enums and const lists (decisions § 791) — not just `types.ts`. Each failure names the file and the declaration. Three things to do:

1. Fix **every** rail the failure names. A widened CHECK typically fails a TS union, a Svelte `<select>` array AND a Dart dropdown list at once; updating only the first leaves the phone unable to offer the new value.
2. If the CHECK is on a NEW column: append an entry to the `PAIRS` array in `apps/web/scripts/check_constraint_unions.mjs`. The guard fails on an unregistered set-shaped CHECK column, so this is not optional. Register every client rail, or an empty `clients` list plus a `note` saying no client enumerates it.
3. Never widen the guard by deleting a rail or adding a blanket exemption. A value a client carries that the column cannot hold goes in that rail's `allowExtra` with a reason; a column value a client deliberately omits goes in `allowMissing`.

Re-run the guard after editing, then `node --test apps/web/scripts/check_constraint_unions.test.mjs`.

### 5. Surface the doc updates

Per `CLAUDE.md` "Docs hygiene", schema changes can require touching:

- `docs/backend/api_database.md` — if a column, index, or RLS policy moved
- `docs/backend/metadata.md` — if a `runs.metadata` jsonb key was added or its semantics changed
- `docs/architecture/conventions.md` — if a new house rule was introduced
- `docs/architecture/decisions.md` — if the change captures a non-obvious trade-off
- `docs/architecture/schema_codegen.md` — if the generator pipeline itself changed
- `docs/product/parity.md` — if the change unlocks a new feature row

Read the migration once more and report which of these you think need touching, with one-sentence justifications. Don't edit them yourself — let the parent (or the human) decide which apply.

### 6. Final report

A short summary:
- Migration applied: yes/no
- Generators run: yes/no, any drift in committed outputs
- Constraint guard: pass/fail
- TS union updates needed: list of unions edited (or "none")
- Docs flagged for update: bullet list with rationale

If everything is clean, end with one line saying so.

## Don't

- Don't generate or alter the migration file's SQL — that's the human's job.
- Don't `git add` or commit. Leave staging to the parent.
- Don't run destructive ops outside the supabase local stack (`supabase db reset` is fine — it only touches the local containerized DB on port 24322).
