// Source-level guard: the watch-ingest bridge has ONE decoder.
//
// The same method-channel payload reaches two places — decoded immediately
// when the runner is signed in, enqueued and decoded on the next sign-in when
// they are not. It used to be decoded by two hand-written copies, and the
// copies had drifted in both directions over the same bridge payload: the
// signed-in one never learned the per-point `bpm` that
// `docs/backend/metadata.md` says the watch-ingest decoder reads, and the
// queue's never learned that the bridge sends `track` as JSON TEXT, so a run
// that arrived while signed out was replayed with no track at all. Neither
// omission is visible from either file on its own, which is why this is a
// guard and not a comment (decisions § 1254).
//
// Anchored on the decode ITSELF, not on a name: constructing a `Run` or a
// `Waypoint` inside the bridge, or assembling a metadata map there, IS the
// second decoder however it is spelled.
