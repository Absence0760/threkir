//! Hardware-free application core for the watch firmware.
//!
//! Everything in this crate is pure logic over plain data: no peripherals,
//! no Embassy, no allocator. The `app/` crate's async tasks are thin glue
//! that move bytes between peripherals and these modules, which keeps the
//! 60-70% host-testable split that `local_testing.md` calls for and means
//! the same core ports unchanged to tier-2 silicon (decisions.md § 90).
//!
//! - [`alerts`] — on-run alerts: drink / eat reminders on the `fuel_plan`
//!   moving-time cadence + the HR-zone ceiling alert
//! - [`backyard`] — backyard-ultra mode: the wall-clock-anchored corral bell,
//!   the loop count riding the recorder's lap, the projected return margin,
//!   and the 3/2/1-minute whistles (watch-native, no web twin)
//! - [`auto_segment_effort`] — pick the route a route-less run followed +
//!   batch its segment-effort rows (port of web
//!   `segments/auto_segment_effort.ts`; reuses [`segments`])
//! - [`fix`] — the GPS fix domain model + the RMC/GGA accumulator
//! - [`gps_distance`] — the spec-v1 GPS distance estimator: Kalman-filtered
//!   position, Doppler speed-over-ground credit, a stationary floor and a gap
//!   re-anchor (port of `scripts/gps_distance/reference.py`, held to the shared
//!   `fixtures/gps_distance_vectors.json`)
//! - [`course`] — breadcrumb course polyline, nearest-point projection,
//!   off-course alert latch, and the panel-fit pixel mapping (fifth parity
//!   port: web `route_snap.ts` / `route_geometry.ts` + the mobile
//!   route-overlay thresholds)
//! - [`course_profile`] — the pushed course's climb profile for the RouteElev
//!   page: gain / loss over the whole pushed series plus a distance-even
//!   elevation series and the along-course marker position
//! - [`nav_project`] — the `nav` task's per-fix composition over [`course`] +
//!   [`turn_cues`]: biased projection, the off-course latch's two edges, and
//!   the next turn ahead
//! - [`cutoff_eta`] — live next-cutoff ETA: on / tight / behind at the nearest
//!   cutoff ahead from distance-along-route + recent pace, honest `Unknown` on
//!   a stale fix (port of web `runs/live_cutoff_eta.ts`)
//! - [`roadbook`] — per-checkpoint race-crew schedule: cumulative distance,
//!   effort-allocated projected arrival, per-leg vert, safe/tight/miss cutoff
//!   verdict (port of web `routes/roadbook.ts`)
//! - [`fuel_plan`] — per-leg carbs/fluid scaled onto the roadbook timeline +
//!   carry-to-next-aid per refill (port of web `routes/fuel_plan.ts`)
//! - [`pace_segments`] — split a track into pace segments with the shared
//!   pace/age colour ramp (port of web `segments/pace_segments.ts`)
//! - [`distance_bands`] — classify a distance into its race-distance band
//!   (port of web `routes/distance_bands.ts`)
//! - [`gear_wear`] — gear/shoe wear state from accumulated mileage
//!   (port of web `gear/gear_wear.ts`)
//! - [`elevation`] — barometric altitude, the cumulative-vert accumulator, and
//!   the quantised gate deciding which 1 Hz sample is worth waking a consumer
//!   for ([`elevation::should_publish`])
//! - [`storm`] — baro-driven storm detection: the sea-level pressure reduction
//!   that separates a front from a climb, its three-hour least-squares
//!   tendency, and the explicit refusal when no GPS altitude corroborates the
//!   barometer (watch-native, no web twin — the phone has no barometer)
//! - [`baro_rezero`] — the `baro` task's manual QNH re-zero decision: the
//!   barometer's own freshness gate over [`elevation::rezero_reference`], the
//!   two distinct refusals, and the reading an applied snap publishes past the
//!   gate
//! - [`gnss_cadence`] — the `gps` task's fix-publication cadence: which
//!   interval is owed in the current record state + mode, the throttle gate,
//!   and whether a published fix earns the receiver a nap
//! - [`gnss_mode`] — the selectable GNSS recording modes (fix interval +
//!   projected battery hours) BTN3 cycles on the idle face
//! - [`gnss_signal`] — the GSV/GSA side channel: the satellites-in-view + fix
//!   mode pair behind the idle signal meter, and the bar-count gate that stops
//!   a repeated GSV group waking a consumer several times a second
//! - [`goals`] — multi-metric run goals: distance / time / pace / run-count
//!   targets over a week or month window (port of web `training/goals.ts`; the
//!   localStorage persistence + UUID id + i18n period label are web-only, dates
//!   collapsed to a day index like [`current_week`])
//! - [`grade_adjusted_pace`] — the Minetti GAP model (fourth parity port) +
//!   the streaming grade estimator the recorder feeds
//! - [`guided_runs`] — scripted coach-voice guided-run library + the
//!   `(prev, now]` tick dispatcher that fires each timed cue (port of web
//!   `training/guided_runs.ts`; cue/title text carried as i18n key identifiers,
//!   the TTS speaking + `GuidedTranslate` injection are web/mobile-only)
//! - [`hr_drain`] — the `hr` task's FIFO drain: PPG / ambient / unknown slot
//!   demux with the ambient latch, plus the between-window wait
//! - [`hr_source`] — the external BLE heart-rate strap's discovery filter +
//!   Heart Rate Measurement codec, and the strap-over-optical precedence rule
//!   the arbitrating task applies (the pure half of the GATT *central* role in
//!   `app/src/tasks/hr_strap.rs`, which the Renode sim cannot exercise at all)
//! - [`hr_zones`] — the app's five-zone %-of-max HR ladder (mirrors web
//!   `training/hr_zones.ts`) + the zone-for-BPM lookup
//! - [`face`] — watch-face layout: state in, text rows out
//! - [`page`] — which run-view screen shows + the page-button cycle order
//! - [`statusbar`] — the idle-face GPS signal-strength bars + the run-view
//!   page-position dot indicator (pure 0..=4 / active-of-total counts; the
//!   face draws the pixels)
//! - [`gauge`] — reduce pacer / gear / fuel / HR-zone metrics to normalised
//!   bar-fill fractions the face draws as visual gauges
//! - [`bar_chart`] — scale a distribution (zone times, pace buckets) into
//!   bottom-aligned bar rectangles for a mini chart
//! - [`battery`] — 1S LiPo supply millivolts → percent (piecewise-linear
//!   discharge curve + the plausibility band the battery task parks on), plus
//!   the gauge icon's fill fraction and low-state threshold
//! - [`battery_sense`] — the `battery` task's SAADC-counts → millivolts
//!   conversion and the one gate that both parks the task at boot and blanks
//!   the gauge mid-stream
//! - [`link`] — phone-link status frames (sim transport today, BLE GATT
//!   characteristic payload at step 6)
//! - [`pacer`] — even-pace target-time virtual partner (ahead/behind vs a
//!   goal distance + time) the recorder folds into its snapshot
//! - [`race_day`] — race-day pacing: days-until, even / negative-split per-unit
//!   splits, the distance-aware pre-race checklist (items as enum ids), goal
//!   feasibility vs a prediction, and the split-time formatter (port of web
//!   `runs/race_day.ts`)
//! - [`race_phases`] — race pacing-strategy phase plans: a distance + preset
//!   sliced into hold-back / settle / race phases whose final factor is derived
//!   so the distance-weighted mean is exactly 1.0 (port of web
//!   `runs/race_phases.ts`; intent is an identifier, labels resolve in [`face`])
//! - [`race_predictor`] — the 5K/10K/Half/Marathon race-time ladder (parity
//!   port of web `training/race_predictor.ts` + the reused Riegel +
//!   prediction-confidence helpers), recency-weighted anchor, per-rung
//!   confidence
//! - [`readiness`] — readiness-to-run score from form / sleep / resting-HR drift
//!   around a 75 baseline + the dominant-contributor advice (port of web
//!   `training/readiness.ts`; notes/advice carried as enums, not English)
//! - [`record`] — recording state machine: commands + fixes in, run totals out
//! - [`record_cadence`] — the `record` task's decisions around that machine:
//!   the live-run tick gate, the mid-run flash-checkpoint cadence, the
//!   fix → stored-track-point shaping, and the pushed-QNH plausibility guard
//! - [`trackback`] — back-to-start: breadcrumb buffer, distance/bearing to
//!   the start, the course-over-ground heading + relative direction arrow
//! - [`stale_budget`] — the shape the fix-cadence-scaled staleness budgets
//!   share (the GAP hold, the TrackBack heading): a 1 Hz baseline widened by
//!   one whole inter-fix gap, with each baseline left to its own module
//! - [`button`] — the pure button-press → record-command mapping
//! - [`input_flow`] — the rest of the button task's decisions: how a BTN3 hold
//!   resolves tier by tier, the in-grid cursor step, the page a press lands on,
//!   and where a dismissed run leaves the view
//! - [`ui_frame`] — per-frame screen decisions: the animation window, the hero
//!   band's precedence, which rows may be skipped, and whether a time-based
//!   refresh is still owed
//! - [`nav_map`] — the Nav page's map panel: whole-course fit vs the
//!   runner-centred auto-zoom window, the position marker, and the repaint key
//! - [`run_store`] — on-device run wire format + BLE sync framing
//! - [`settings`] — phone→watch settings frame (max HR / pacer goal / gear /
//!   HR-zone ceiling) decoded into the recorder's settings-sync hooks
//! - [`settings_frame`] — where one pushed settings frame ends and the next
//!   begins on the phone link's delimiter-less pipe: the idle-gap boundary, the
//!   one-maximal-frame buffer, and the oversize latch (the pure half of
//!   `app/src/tasks/phone.rs`'s `settings_rx`)
//! - [`settings_apply`] — the fan-out that frame drives: each present field
//!   routed to its sink as one typed effect, exhaustive by construction so a
//!   newly-added field cannot be silently dropped
//! - [`settings_queue`] — the depth of the frame queue between that decode and
//!   that fan-out, and why a delta-carrying frame may never be coalesced into a
//!   latest-value slot
//! - [`flash_store`] — tier-1 internal-flash slot layout for finished runs
//! - [`flash_plan`] — which slot a commit / checkpoint lands in and the erase +
//!   write range it implies, where a chunk request reads from, and the boot
//!   recovery scan over a [`flash_plan::SlotReader`] (the pure decisions the
//!   `app/src/run_flash.rs` driver wraps around [`flash_store`])
//! - [`ble_sync`] — `run_manifest` value framing, the `run_chunk` notify bound
//!   and request-queue depth, and the `course` write's offset header (the pure
//!   half of the GATT characteristics `app/src/tasks/ble.rs` serves, which the
//!   Renode sim cannot exercise at all)
//! - [`training_load`] — single-run + rolling CTL/ATL/TSB training-load
//!   estimate (port of web `training/training_load.ts`)
//! - [`age_grade`] — age-graded performance % for a standard-distance effort
//!   against the USATF-MLDR 2025 factor tables (port of web `runs/age_grade.ts`

//! - [`exercise_calories`] — gross run/gym kcal for the dynamic-TDEE nutrition
//!   goal (port of web `nutrition/exercise_calories.ts`)
//! - [`training_paces`] — the five Daniels intensity-zone paces from a goal
//!   pace, with female + masters calibration (port of the pace-zone surface of
//!   web `training/training.ts`; reuses [`race_predictor::riegel_predict`])
//! - [`fitness`] — VDOT / VO2max / per-run TSS / recovery advice + the
//!   Fitness-card training-load snapshot (port of web `training/fitness.ts`;
//!   the ISO date + `nowMs` collapse to an integer day index like
//!   [`training_load`])
//! - [`route_markers`] — course-marker kind catalogue + `sort_markers` +
//!   `parse_cutoff` + the aid-services vocabulary (port of web
//!   `routes/route_markers.ts`; `parse_cutoff` mirrors the copy inlined in
//!   [`roadbook`]/[`cutoff_eta`], a later de-dup target)
//! - [`checkpoint_projection`] — grade a runner from aid-station crossings:
//!   projected arrival at each remaining checkpoint + safe/tight/miss verdict
//!   (port of web `runs/checkpoint_projection.ts`; reuses
//!   [`roadbook::CutoffStatus`] + [`cutoff_eta::CUTOFF_TIGHT_S`])
//! - [`route_description`] — bucket a route's stats into structured parts + the
//!   canonical English assembler, the offline "describe this route" baseline
//!   (port of web `routes/route_description.ts`; reuses
//!   [`distance_bands::band_for_distance`])
//! - [`route_elevation`] — positive-delta elevation gain + evenly-spaced
//!   coordinate sampling (the pure half of web `routes/elevation.ts`, renamed to
//!   avoid the [`elevation`] barometric-accumulator collision; `fetchElevations`
//!   is a browser network hop and stays web-only)
//! - [`route_geometry`] — interpolate a fraction to a distance-weighted point on
//!   a route polyline + the inverse distance-along-route projection + cumulative
//!   length (port of web `routes/route_geometry.ts`; the self-contained twin of
//!   the [`course`] nav-overlay projection)
//! - [`route_gpx`] — course-waypoint GPX export: the route line as a `<trk>`
//!   plus one `<wpt>` per course marker, kind→`<sym>` + cutoff/services in
//!   `<desc>` (port of web `routes/route_gpx.ts`; reuses
//!   [`route_markers::parse_cutoff`], builds into a `heapless::String`)
//! - [`route_simplify`] — Ramer-Douglas-Peucker track simplification + the
//!   route summary (simplified waypoints + equirectangular distance +
//!   elevation gain) (port of web `routes/route_simplify.ts`; iterative RDP
//!   over a fixed-capacity stack, no recursion)
//! - [`plan_progress`] — base→build→peak→taper phase ordering + longest
//!   completed long run (port of web `training/plan_progress.ts`)
//! - [`plan_adherence`] — weekly drift over/under + missed-workout make-up/skip
//!   advice as enums (port of web `training/plan_adherence.ts`)

//!   missed sessions (port of web `training/plan_replan.ts`; reuses
//!   [`plan_adherence::weekly_drift`] + [`plan_adherence::missed_workout_advice`])
//! - [`plan_adaptive_replan`] — gate a re-plan on a multi-week adherence trend
//!   (2-of-3 trailing completed weeks flagged), then delegate the deltas to
//!   [`plan_replan::replan_remaining`] (port of web
//!   `training/plan_adaptive_replan.ts`; reuses [`plan_adherence::weekly_drift`])
//! - [`current_week`] — bucket activities onto the seven days of the real
//!   calendar week honouring the week-start pref (port of web
//!   `training/current_week.ts`; ISO dates collapsed to a Unix-epoch day index)
//! - [`nutrition_targets`] — Mifflin-St Jeor BMR → calorie + macro targets from
//!   goal (port of web `nutrition/nutrition_targets.ts`)
//! - [`challenge_progress`] — challenge progress fraction / rank / on-pace
//!   projection (port of web `social/challenge_progress.ts`; reuses
//!   [`pacer::ON_PACE_BAND`])
//! - [`badges`] — achievement catalogue + `evaluate_badges` + `tier_for`,
//!   thresholds in lockstep with the SQL awarder (port of web
//!   `social/badges.ts`; i18n label keys carried as identifiers, not strings)
//! - [`locale_defaults`] — locale → default unit + week-start region tables
//!   (port of web `format/locale_defaults.ts`; the `Intl` fallback is web-only)
//! - [`privacy`] — privacy-zone track clipping: trim leading/trailing points
//!   inside a home/work zone (port of web `routes/privacy.ts`
//!   `clipPointsToZones`)
//! - [`segments`] — segment effort from a track + competition-rank (1224) +
//!   the age-band vocabulary + crown-label enum (port of web
//!   `segments/segments.ts`)
//! - [`track_projection`] — project a lat/lng track into panel x/y for a
//!   preview thumbnail, plus the `is_track_renderable` 5 m span gate that
//!   refuses to draw a stationary jitter cluster (port of web
//!   `routes/track_projection.ts`; the Dart twin `projectTrack` /
//!   `isTrackRenderable` lives inside `track_preview.dart`)
//! - [`run_heatmap`] — grid-quantise many tracks into clamped weighted cells +
//!   the fit box (port of web `routes/run_heatmap.ts`; the MapLibre GeoJSON
//!   emitters are web-only)
//! - [`run_stats`] — on-demand run stats from a GPS track: moving time,
//!   positive elevation gain, per-unit splits (port of web `runs/run_stats.ts`;
//!   reuses [`grade_adjusted_pace::haversine_metres`], epoch-ms timestamps)
//! - [`relink_candidates`] — the runs eligible to re-link to a planned workout
//!   (±7-day window, excluding already-linked) (port of web
//!   `training/relink_candidates.ts`; dates collapsed to a day index)
//! - [`live_freshness`] — spectator staleness: age clamp + stale flag + display
//!   bucket, so a lost-signal runner reads stale (port of web
//!   `runs/live_freshness.ts`)
//! - [`finisher_certificate`] — certificate eligibility + the time / distance /
//!   ordinal-place formatters (port of the shaping half of web
//!   `runs/finisher_certificate.ts`; the SVG/PNG builder is web-only)
//! - [`recap`] — Year / Month-in-Running aggregator: totals, run-family
//!   longest/fastest, top week, streaks, monthly strip + the earned trophy grid
//!   (port of web `runs/recap.ts`; reuses [`current_week::dow_of`] +
//!   [`locale_defaults::DistanceUnit`], ISO timestamps collapsed to day indices)
//! - [`streaks`] — current + best run-streak counts with the Strava grace rule
//!   (port of web `runs/streaks.ts`; ISO local-day keys collapsed to a day
//!   index, so the day-step arithmetic is DST-safe by construction)
//! - [`pr_recency`] — the relative age of a PR date as a language-free bucket
//!   enum, softening an old best for a returning runner (port of web
//!   `runs/pr_recency.ts`; ISO dates collapsed to a day index)
//! - [`turn_cues`] — offline turn-by-turn cues from a route polyline's bearing
//!   deltas at each interior vertex (port of web `routes/turn_cues.ts`)
//! - [`timers`] — the countdown timer / stopwatch behind the idle BTN2 modal
//!   and [`page::Page::Timer`]: one instrument whose preset ladder starts at a
//!   stopwatch, whose expiry counts UP past zero because nothing on this device
//!   can notify anyone, and which raises no alarm (§ 375)
//! - [`race_config`] — the `RCF1` config-page record that makes a phone-pushed
//!   race configuration (pacer goal, HR ceiling, QNH, fuel cadence and the rest
//!   of the `SET1` subset with no other home) survive a brown-out; the record's
//!   body IS a `SET1` frame, so the restore path is the push path
