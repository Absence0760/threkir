/**
 * WCAG 1.4.10 reflow over the STATIC routes: no route may make the document
 * scroll sideways at the 320 CSS px the criterion names, at the 360 px a common
 * phone reports, nor at the 300 px added as renderer headroom.
 *
 * The measurement contract — the three viewports, the derivation-not-a-pixel
 * assertion, and the population halves — lives in `../fixtures/reflow`, shared
 * with the seeded-dynamic sweep in `reflow-seeded-routes.spec.ts`.
 *
 * The population check here is a visible control or heading inside the page
 * region plus a node-count floor: the weakest pair that rules out a spinner or
 * a redirect stub (§ 534). A heading alone would not do — `/routes` and
 * `/plans` carry their title in the surface-tab strip and have no `h1` in their
 * loaded state at all, which the first draft discovered by failing.
