-- Pins migration 20270630000001 (decisions § 823): a Stripe Refund is a ROW,
-- so a refund that failed is queryable rather than a `console.error`.
--
-- § 789 built `refund_failed` and refused to move `partially_refunded` on
-- either ledger — rightly, on both counts. What it left was a partial refund
-- whose failure had no representation anywhere: `event_orders` carries no
-- refunded amount at all, and `donations.refunded_cents` went on stating an
-- instalment that had come back to us. The answer is not a status; it is the
-- missing noun. Every claim § 823 makes about the database is pinned here:
--
--   * the reversal correction: a failed refund on a `partially_refunded`
--     donation puts its amount back into the thermometer and the feed, and a
--     SUCCEEDED one does not;
--   * idempotency BY CONSTRUCTION: replaying one refund id leaves one row and
--     moves no total — the property the arithmetic § 789 refused cannot have;
--   * the terminal latch: a benign out-of-order `pending` cannot un-say a
--     failure that already landed;
--   * the clamp: no child row can push a donation past its own amount;
--   * exactly one parent ledger per refund, and a status the CHECK admits;
--   * no client role can read the table at all, and only the service role can
--     write it.
--
-- fundraiser_totals / fundraiser_feed are called as `anon`, the public
-- thermometer's real caller. Calling them as service_role is what makes
-- donations_status_lock_test fail on a workstation CLI image (§ 799).
