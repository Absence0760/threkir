# Wait until the local Supabase stack's sidecars actually serve, and leave
# the evidence behind when one of them never does.
#
# `supabase start` returns before its sidecars can serve. This wait used to
# be three byte-identical copies inline in ci.yml (e2e-web, the OAuth lane,
# the SSO lane) and every one of them was vacuous: they polled with
# `-X POST` and treated ANY status other than curl's `000` as ready, on the
# stated theory that "kong routed + the upstream answered". kong answers on
# its own when it CANNOT reach an upstream — 503 `{"message":"name
# resolution failed"}` with the edge runtime down, 503 `{"code":"BOOT_ERROR"}`
# while a worker is failing to boot — and the function it probed
# (refresh-tokens) returns 503 `cron_not_configured` in CI anyway, so the two
# were indistinguishable. The loop therefore passed on its first poll against
# a stack that was still cold, which is how CI run 31361094964 (e2e shard 4)
# spent its first 2.5 minutes timing out every delete-account-guards request
# at 30s and then ran green for the rest of the shard. The same comment
# already blamed an earlier instance of that exact failure (run 26478978751,
# same spec, same shard).
#
# So each probe below names the answer that only the upstream itself can give:
#   - the edge runtime by clip-public-track's own 405 (verify_jwt is false, so
#     a GET reaches the handler; the 405 is pinned by
#     clip-public-track-guards.spec.ts),
#   - GoTrue by a real password grant rather than /health, because what the
#     suites open with is minting a token, and
#   - Storage REST by any answer of its own.
#
# The budget is a WALL-CLOCK deadline, not an attempt count. It used to be
# `for i in $(seq 1 45)` with `sleep 2` and an error string that claimed
# "within 90s": that arithmetic charges the sleeps and nothing else, so an
# attempt that spends curl's whole `--max-time` is free. Two 2026-08-14 jobs
# died here with `edge runtime (clip-public-track) never became ready within
# 90s` after ~45 attempts spanning ~9 minutes — 45 x (10s --max-time + 2s
# sleep) = 540s, i.e. the loop, not the message, was telling the truth about
# the wait and the message was understating it 6x. Every attempt is now
# charged against the deadline and the last attempt's `--max-time` is clamped
# to what is left of it, so the failure costs what it says it costs. The
# budget itself is deliberately NOT widened: a run that answers within 10s
# (kong's 503 while the runtime is booting) still gets the same ~45 tries it
# always did, and a run where every attempt burns the full --max-time is a
# stack that is not coming up at all.
#
# 90s is kept because it was MEASURED against green runs, not inherited.
# Across 277 jobs carrying this step in 14 workflow runs (2026-08-13 to
# 2026-08-19 — every stack-using job: 14 e2e shards, the SSO/OAuth and
# live-hub lanes, pgtap, edge-functions, api_client, cross-client, schema
# drift), the 275 green ones took a median of 1.21s and a maximum of 12.15s,
# 274 of them finished under 2s, and exactly ONE needed a retry at all (one
# attempt, e2e shard 10/14 in run 32150279557). So the worst healthy boot on
# record uses 13% of the deadline. Converting an attempt count into a real
# deadline does tighten the effective ceiling from ~540s to 90s; the tightening
# is only ever spent by the failure mode it is meant to bound, because an
# attempt that fails costs the whole 10s --max-time when it fails at all
# (measured: attempts 2-45 of run 31834502152 are 12.013s apart to the
# millisecond), and 90s still affords 8 such attempts against the 1 observed.
