// Guardrail: a source file that declares a cross-platform twin is a REGISTERED
// parity pair or a recorded judgement that it is not one, and the file it names
// exists. The judgement is re-derived rather than remembered.
//
// `check_parity_pair_registry.mjs` cross-checks the two registries — CLAUDE.md's
// lockstep bullet and the shared-library-syncer agent's table — against each
// other. Both can agree perfectly about a pair that is in neither of them. That
// is not a hypothetical: `turn_cues` diverged in THREE implementations at once
// while registered nowhere (decisions § 641), and the web/mobile accent fold sat
// diverged for eighteen days while both doc comments claimed lockstep
// (decisions § 760). CLAUDE.md states the failure mode outright — "a pair added
// here without a row there is a pair whose divergence is never detected" — and
// the guard it points at can only see pairs one of the two registries already
// names.
//
// So the subject here is the SOURCE, not the registries. A header comment
// saying "Dart twin of `apps/web/src/lib/x/y.ts`" is a claim of lockstep made in
// the place a reader will actually see it, and it is the earliest artifact of a
// pair's existence — it is written when the second half is written, months
// before anyone thinks about a registry. Four properties:
//
//   1. The counterpart path a declaration names EXISTS. A file that moved
//      leaves the claim pointing at nothing, and the reader then cannot find
//      the half they were told to keep in step. This is the same defect
//      `check_parity_pair_registry`'s property 4 exists for, one layer out: that
//      one reads the registries, so a stale path in a SOURCE header is invisible
//      to it. Checked wherever a declaration sits, header or not — a dangling
//      path is a dangling path, and no resolution guessing is involved.
//
//   2. The declaration corresponds to a row of the syncer table carrying BOTH
//      files. The table is the operative registry — the syncer agent is the only
//      automated detector of parity divergence, and it works from that table
//      alone. A declared pair missing from it is a pair whose divergence is
//      never caught, while its own header reads as though it is covered. Both
//      halves must sit in the SAME row: two files each registered against some
//      other partner are two pairs, not one, and the flattened membership test
//      this guard used to run could not tell those apart.
//
//   3. A claim the registries cannot carry — a screen, a widget, render glue,
//      a header that names the pair it DRIVES rather than its own — resolves to
//      a NOT_PAIRS entry instead. A twin-shaped sentence gets exactly two
//      honest answers, "registered" and "judged not a pair with this reason",
//      and no third one where the guard simply cannot see it.
//
//   4. Every NOT_PAIRS entry is still true. § 1244 answered "is this a lockstep
//      pair?" with NO for five module pairs and recorded the answer by REWORDING
//      the headers, which left the judgement as prose nothing re-derives: if one
//      of them later grows real shared logic the honest answer flips and only a
//      reader notices. Each entry now carries the shared top-level symbol set
//      measured at the time it was written, and the guard re-measures it. A
//      converging surface, a file that moved, or a pair that has since been
//      registered each fail — the shape `UNREGISTERED_DEFINER_RELATIONS` uses in
//      `apps/backend/scripts/pgtap_definer_neutralisers.mjs` (decisions § 1273).
//
// Registration is checked by PATH rather than by name. The registry keys a pair
// on its WEB basename, so `gear_rotation_pick.dart` (the pair `rotation_pick`)
// is registered under a name its own filename does not carry; a name-keyed check
// would report it and teach the next reader to distrust the guard.
//
// KNOWN_GAPS is the register of declarations that violate property 1 or 2
// TODAY. Every entry is a real defect, not an exemption on the merits — closing
// one means editing CLAUDE.md, the syncer table, or the header, none of which
// this guard can do. An entry that has stopped being a violation FAILS, so the
// register can only shrink, and an entry naming a declaration that no longer
// exists fails too rather than sitting as cover. NOT_PAIRS is the opposite kind
// of list: those entries are judgements on the merits, and each carries the
// measurement that would flip it.
//
// Run: `node scripts/check_twin_claims.mjs`
// CI:  the `parity-matrix` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml, which is in the
//      `CI gate` aggregator's `needs:` list. Deliberately NOT gated on
//      `needs.changes.outputs.code`: half its input is markdown, and deleting a
//      syncer row is a docs-only diff that orphans every declaration it covered.
// Unit tests: `node --test scripts/check_twin_claims.test.mjs`
