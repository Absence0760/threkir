-- The whole-schema contract behind 20270625000001 and 20270626000001: the set
-- of `public` functions an anonymous caller may execute is a closed list, and
-- everything else is withheld in the form that withholds on every image this
-- schema runs on.
--
-- anon_execute_registry_test.sql pins the RULE (with probe functions, against
-- whichever image is running) and the four functions the first migration
-- withheld. This file pins the SET, for the whole schema, so a function added
-- tomorrow without a revoke fails here rather than shipping open.
--
-- ── Reading it on two images ──
-- A fresh `public` function comes up `proacl` NULL — owner + PUBLIC — on a
-- current workstation CLI, and with an explicit {anon, authenticated,
-- service_role} grant on Supabase Cloud and on CI (`supabase/setup-cli` pinned
-- to 2.84.2). decisions.md 799 has the measurement. That gives the two
-- assertions below different strengths, deliberately:
--
--   * (1) reads `has_function_privilege`, which is the literal truth on each
--     image. On CI -- the image prod resembles -- it catches EVERY newly added
--     function that no migration revoked, because such a function arrives
--     anon-granted by name.
--   * (2) reads the ACL SHAPE instead: `proacl` NULL, a PUBLIC entry, or an
--     anon entry. That is what survives a `drop function` + `create function`,
--     which re-issues whichever default the image has, and it is the half that
--     bites on a workstation.
--
-- Both pass on either image. Neither alone is the contract.
--
-- ── Scope ──
-- `public` only: the CLI exposes `public` and `graphql_public` to PostgREST, so
-- a `private` function is unreachable by an anonymous HTTP caller whatever its
-- ACL, and thirteen of them carry a deliberate anon grant because policies on
-- anon-readable tables name them.
--
-- Trigger-returning functions are excluded from (1) and (2) and the exclusion
-- is itself asserted, in (4): no grant makes one callable -- Postgres refuses
-- with 0A000 before privileges are consulted -- so 67 of them still carry the
-- image default and none of it is reachable.
--
-- Extension-owned functions are excluded too. `global_segments_test` installs
-- pgtap `with schema public`, and postgis or pg_trgm could be relocated there
-- by a future stack change; several hundred extension functions arriving with
-- the image default are the extension's business, not this schema's.
--
-- (5) and (6) are the positive control for the second half of 20270626000001,
-- which withheld `authenticated` as well as anon from the cron and job-queue
-- family. Any signed-up account holds the same create-time grant anon does, so
-- on Cloud a logged-in user could drain the queue; and a sweep that revoked
-- EXECUTE from every role would close that while breaking pg_cron's operator
-- hook, which (6) is here to fail on. The over-revoke direction needs no
-- literal registry: 264 pgtap files exercise those functions as
-- `authenticated`, so an over-broad revoke fails in the suite that covers the
-- feature.
--
-- (7) and (8) close the hole (5) cannot. (5) is exactly as complete as the
-- `server_only` fixture, and the fixture is derived from what the repo SAYS —
-- so a new cron routine whose migration simply forgets `authenticated` is in
-- nobody's list and is asserted by nothing. (7) derives its population from
-- `cron.job` instead: a routine pg_cron runs on a schedule is server-only by
-- construction, because cron executes it as `postgres` and needs no grant, and
-- the requirement cannot be removed without unscheduling the job. (8) is (7)'s
-- own control — the same population read a second, independent way — because a
-- name-matching predicate that quietly matched nothing would leave (7) green
-- over an empty set.

-- The routines this repo STATES are withheld from `authenticated` as well as
-- anon — the cron and job-queue family (20270626000001, and
-- cleanup_stale_rate_limits by 20270625000001), the privacy oracles
-- (20270521_001), the derived-cache refreshers, and the secret deleters. Kept
-- for service_role where an operator or an Edge Function invokes it by hand.
-- pg_cron runs its own as `postgres` and needs no grant at all.
--
-- **This list is derived, not hand-kept**, and
-- `apps/backend/scripts/check_server_only_registry.mjs` is what makes that
-- true: it replays every migration and fails the PR when a routine some
-- migration revokes from `authenticated` is missing here, when a row here
-- names a routine no migration revokes, or when `keeps_service_role`
-- disagrees with the grant the migrations state. It was hand-kept until
-- 20270710, and it had drifted — 42 non-trigger `public` routines carried
-- such a revoke and 26 were listed, two of the sixteen missing
-- (`enqueue_safety_overdue_emails`, `sweep_challenge_completions`) sitting in
-- the very cron family this fixture is the positive control for.
--
-- The derivation reads the migration TEXT and the assertions below read the
-- CATALOGUE, which is the whole point: deriving the list from `proacl` would
-- make (5) assert that routines without the privilege do not have the
-- privilege. `keeps_service_role` comes from the same replay rather than from
-- a catalogue reading, because on the CI image every fresh routine arrives
-- with a service_role entry by name and a `true` read off it would say
-- nothing.
