# infra/

Terraform stacks for the AWS web hosting plan ([decisions.md § 53](../docs/architecture/decisions.md#53-web-app--domain-on-aws-s3--cloudfront--lambda--route-53-not-vercel-or-cloudflare-pages)). One module + per-env stacks for `prod` and `preview`, plus shared `dns` and `github-oidc` stacks. Runtime secrets via sops + AWS KMS.

For the operational walkthrough (cost, rollback, observability, DR), read [`apps/web/deployment.md`](../apps/web/deployment.md) — this file is the **how-to-apply** index.

## Layout

```
infra/
├── bootstrap/           one-time: S3 state bucket
├── modules/
│   └── web-stack/       reusable per-env: S3 + CloudFront + Lambda
│                        + KMS + IAM + alarms
├── dns/                 hosted zone + ACM cert (one stack, both envs share)
├── github-oidc/         OIDC provider + per-env deploy roles
└── envs/
    ├── prod/            calls web-stack with env=prod
    └── preview/         calls web-stack with env=preview
```

Each stack has its own remote state in the bucket created by `bootstrap`. State locking is S3-native via `use_lockfile = true` (Terraform ≥ 1.10) — no DynamoDB table required. The `dns` and `github-oidc` outputs are consumed by per-env stacks via `terraform_remote_state`.

**Region.** Everything sits in `us-east-1`. The ACM cert for CloudFront *has* to live there regardless, and putting the rest of the stack alongside it avoids cross-region complexity. The per-env stacks still expose a `us_east_1` provider alias so a future region move only touches the primary region. To deploy somewhere else, change the default in every `aws_region` variable + every `region` field in the `backend.tf` files + the `AWS_REGION` env in `.github/workflows/release-web.yml` — and read the two `aws_cloudfront_*` alarms in `modules/web-stack/alarms.tf`, which deliberately use the DEFAULT provider: CloudFront publishes its metrics only in `us-east-1`, and a CloudWatch alarm's actions must live in the alarm's own region as `aws_sns_topic.alerts` does.

**Cost.** Idle monthly: hosted zone $0.50 + 2 KMS keys $2 + S3 / CloudFront / Lambda well under $1 = **~$3/month**. Plus domain registration if you don't already own one (~$15/year for a `.app`).

## What CI enforces about this tree

Four jobs read `infra/`, none of which needs AWS credentials, and all four
block a merge. The first three live in `terraform.yml`, which since
2026-09-04 is a `workflow_call`-only file that `ci.yml`'s `terraform` job
calls — before that it carried its own path-filtered triggers, which made
its rows advisory: branch protection requires one context, the `CI gate`
aggregator in `ci.yml`, and a `needs:` entry cannot name a job in another
workflow (decisions § 1149). The call is skipped, not run, when a diff
touches nothing under `infra/` — `ci.yml`'s `changes` job carries the path
filter that used to sit on the triggers.

| Job (`.github/workflows/…`) | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `fmt (whole tree)` (`terraform.yml`, called by `ci.yml`) | `terraform fmt -check -recursive infra`. One pass over every directory, including ones outside the validate matrix — a per-stack `working-directory` reads that stack's own `.tf` files and nothing below them, which left `modules/web-stack` unformatted-checked (decisions § 1111). |
| `validate` (`terraform.yml`, called by `ci.yml`, one per stack) | `terraform validate` with `-backend=false`. Syntax, provider constraints, reference shapes. **Not** anything about applied state. `modules/web-stack` is not in the matrix — a module taking an aliased provider from its caller cannot be validated standalone — and is validated transitively by both env roots instead (measured: an undeclared-variable reference in the module fails `validate` in `envs/prod`). |
| `Trivy IaC scan` (`terraform.yml`, called by `ci.yml`) | Known-bad IaC patterns across the whole tree. Suppressions with rationale live in `.trivyignore` at the repo root. |
| `infra-guards` (`ci.yml`) | `scripts/check_infra_iam.mjs` + `scripts/check_infra_error_responses.mjs` + `scripts/check_infra_coverage.mjs` — see below. |

**`check_infra_iam.mjs`** reads `github-oidc/main.tf` + its `variables.tf`,
`modules/web-stack/main.tf`, both `envs/<env>/main.tf`, every workflow under
`.github/workflows/` and every composite action under `.github/actions/`:

- each deploy role's trust policy uses `StringEquals` (never `StringLike`) on a
  wildcard-free `repo:<owner/repo>:environment:<name>` sub, with `:aud` pinned;
- the GitHub environments `release-web.yml` can declare are exactly the ones the
  roles trust, paired through the one `refs/tags/web@` predicate both branch on
  — the lockstep whose breakage failed the `web@1.0.3` release;
- no action ending in `:*`, and `Resource = "*"` only for actions declared in the
  guard's `RESOURCELESS_ACTIONS` with the reason AWS models no resource for them;
- every resource ARN in a role's policy carries that role's own environment
  token and none of the other's, so a copy-pasted `prod` in the preview policy
  fails rather than reading as two tidy blocks;
- the eight Lambda ARNs in each deploy policy match the module's functions;
- every Lambda Function URL is `AWS_IAM`-authed and carries **both** CloudFront
  grants (`lambda:InvokeFunctionUrl` and plain `lambda:InvokeFunction`);
- no Lambda environment merges the decrypted sops map whole;
- **no credential reaches a Lambda environment in plaintext.** `environment {
  variables }` is returned by every API that returns a `FunctionConfiguration`,
  including `lambda:UpdateFunctionCode`, which the release role holds — so a
  plaintext key there is readable by anything that can deploy. The coach and
  generate-route credentials are encrypted at apply time into one
  `aws_kms_ciphertext` blob per function and decrypted by the handler at cold
  start ([§ 1659](../docs/architecture/decisions.md)). The guard fails on a
  plaintext sops key that is not declared non-credential with a reason, on a key
  that is both encrypted and plaintext, on a blob with no per-function
  encryption context, on a blob no env reads or two envs share, and on a stale
  exemption;
- **no env root makes a principal CI can assume a `kms:Decrypt` principal on the
  secrets CMK**, while no credentialed workflow job runs `terraform` and no
  `aws_lambda_function` sets `kms_key_arn` — which none may, because that field
  makes Lambda hand the decrypted environment back to the same callers and
  demands the DEPLOY role hold `kms:Decrypt`. The EXECUTION role's identifier in
  the same statement is checked in the other direction: it was unexercised until
  § 1659 and is load-bearing now, because it is what decrypts the cold-start
  blob. Both directions fail: a wire
  restored while nothing exercises it is standing privilege on the one key whose
  loss is unrecoverable, and an empty wire once either premise breaks is a
  release that `AccessDenied`s mid-deploy ([§ 1021](../docs/architecture/decisions.md)).
  The knob is `kms_decrypt_principal_arn`, which both env roots leave at `""`.
- the `lambda:` actions on each deploy role equal the set of `aws lambda`
  operations the workflows actually invoke, derived from their `run:` bodies
  (comment lines excluded, so a verb cannot justify itself by being mentioned).
  `GetFunction`, `GetAlias` and `PublishVersion` were granted and exercised by
  nothing ([§ 1085](../docs/architecture/decisions.md)). A verb a role needs but
  lacks fails too — that direction is a release that `AccessDenied`s mid-deploy.

**`check_infra_coverage.mjs`** reads the directory listing, `terraform.yml`,
`.github/dependabot.yml`, the module + its `variables.tf`, `waf.tf` and both
env roots:

- every directory holding `.tf` is in the terraform workflow's `stack:` matrix
  (or exempt with the measured reason `validate` cannot run against it) **and**
  has a `terraform` ecosystem entry in `dependabot.yml`, in both directions;
- every `aws_lambda_function` in the module carries an error-rate alarm and a
  p95 alarm, and the distribution carries a 4xx and a 5xx rate alarm;
- no `custom_error_response` maps a 4xx/5xx to a **2xx**. `custom_error_response`
  is distribution-wide, so one that does launders every origin's error at once —
  which is what made ten `/share/*` paths soft 404s. The single legitimate
  mapping (403 → 200, the SPA deep-link path) is declared in
  `ALLOWED_STATUS_LAUNDERING` with its reason, and a declared exemption nothing
  uses fails too ([§ 1022](../docs/architecture/decisions.md));

**`check_infra_error_responses.mjs`** reads the module's distribution and the
`apps/web/lambda/share-*` handlers together, because the second is the premise
under the first:

- there is no `custom_error_response` for **404**. The five share Lambdas return
  the SPA shell at 404 themselves since [§ 1036](../docs/architecture/decisions.md),
  so the mapping replaced their body with an identical one from S3 minus the
  `noindex` that lives only in the Lambda body — dropping it is what puts the tag
  on the wire, and it also stops `/api/coach*`'s JSON 404 being answered as HTML
  ([§ 1084](../docs/architecture/decisions.md));
- the **403** mapping is still there and still answers 200. Answering it honestly
  is the opposite failure: every dynamic client route is a missing S3 key, so a
  403 the SPA does not absorb breaks the whole app;
- every share handler still answers its own 404 with `notFoundShell`, derived
  from the directory listing rather than a list. With the mapping gone, whatever
  the handler returns is what the reader gets.

- every WAF rate-limit scope-down matching `uri_path` carries a `URL_DECODE`
  text transformation and no `LOWERCASE`, and no rate-based rule is left with no
  readable scope-down at all ([§ 1023](../docs/architecture/decisions.md));
- every routing-engine URL the module takes — derived as a `_url` string input
  defaulting to `""` — is declared and wired in **every** env root, so preview
  can be configured the way prod can ([§ 1024](../docs/architecture/decisions.md)).

Each guard has its own `node --test` suite, run in the same job: a source-reading
guard's failure mode is a parser that silently stops matching and passes
vacuously, not a false negative. See [decisions.md §§ 889-893](../docs/architecture/decisions.md)
for what each rule is about, [§§ 1021-1024](../docs/architecture/decisions.md) for
the four added in round 34, and § 893 for where the guards stop — nothing here
compares the Terraform against applied state, which needs credentials and a plan.

Adding a stack means: the directory, an entry in the `stack:` matrix, an entry in
`dependabot.yml`. Both guards will tell you which one you forgot.

### 0. Phase-0 prereqs (skip what you already have)

Working from zero — no AWS account, no domain, no AWS CLI:

**0.1 — AWS account.** Sign up at https://aws.amazon.com/. Enable MFA on the root account, create an Identity Center user with `AdministratorAccess` (we tighten later), and assign it to the account. Note the **AWS access portal URL** Identity Center gives you (`https://d-xxxxxx.awsapps.com/start`). Account-wide spend alerts are Terraformed in `infra/envs/prod/budgets.tf` (50 % / 100 % ACTUAL + 100 % FORECASTED notifications); set `monthly_budget_limit_usd` and `budget_alert_emails` in `terraform.tfvars` before the prod apply.

**0.2 — Domain.** Either register one fresh (Porkbun, Namecheap, Cloudflare Registrar — all fine; you don't need Route 53 to register, only to host DNS) or pick an apex you already own. The default examples use `threkir.com` — search the repo for it and swap if you're using something else. The places that hardcode it are:
- `infra/dns/` — set `apex_domain` in the committed `infra/dns/terraform.tfvars` (which also carries `email_auth_records`, the Resend DKIM/SPF/MX/DMARC set plus the `default._bimi` sender-logo record — public DNS data, Terraformed so a DR rebuild restores mail deliverability instead of dropping it; the BIMI logo render is gated on DMARC reaching enforcement + a paid VMC, see docs/features/email.md § Sender brand logo)
- `infra/envs/{preview,prod}/terraform.tfvars` — set `apex_domain` there (canonical copies live in the private estate repo as `../infra-secrets/threkir/{preview,prod}.tfvars`, symlinked into place — see § 4/5)
- `infra/envs/preview/variables.tf` + `infra/envs/prod/variables.tf` — `default = "threkir.com"` if you want a fallback

**0.3 — Workstation tooling.**

- Terraform ≥ 1.13 (`dnf install terraform`)
- AWS CLI v2 (already installed per workstation conventions)
- sops (already installed; uses age locally + AWS KMS for shared)
- The PRIVATE estate secrets repo cloned as a sibling of this repo: `git clone git@github.com:Absence0760/infra-secrets.git ../infra-secrets`. Production sops ciphertext lives there (under `threkir/`), never in this public repo. Set `INFRA_SECRETS_DIR` / `TF_VAR_secrets_file` if your clone lives elsewhere.

**0.4 — AWS CLI SSO.**

```bash
aws configure sso
# SSO start URL: <your access portal URL from 0.1>
# SSO Region: us-east-1
# default region: us-east-1
# default output: json
# profile name: threkir     (the commands below assume this name)

aws sso login --profile threkir
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile threkir   # proves it works

# Persist the profile choice for future shells:
echo 'export AWS_PROFILE=threkir' > ~/.bashrc.d/26-aliases-aws.sh
```

### 1. Bootstrap (one-time — S3 state bucket)

```bash
cd infra/bootstrap
terraform init
terraform apply -var "state_bucket_name=threkir-tfstate"
```

Creates the S3 bucket every other stack uses for remote state. **Local state only** — never migrate this stack into the bucket it creates.

### 2. DNS

```bash
cd ../dns
terraform init
terraform apply -var "apex_domain=threkir.com"
```

Outputs the four NS records — paste those at the registrar that owns `threkir.com`. Wait for propagation (typically <5 min, occasionally an hour) before continuing — ACM cert validation requires the NS delegation to be live (the apply's `aws_acm_certificate_validation` polls for up to ~75 min, so it's fine to do this mid-apply).

If the domain is registered **in Route 53**, registration auto-created its own hosted zone and the domain points at *that* zone's name servers, not the Terraform zone's. Switch the registered domain over (`aws route53domains update-domain-nameservers --region us-east-1 --domain-name <apex> --nameservers Name=… Name=… Name=… Name=…`) and delete the auto-created duplicate zone ($0.50/mo).

### 3. GitHub OIDC

```bash
cd ../github-oidc
terraform init
terraform apply    # github_repo comes from the committed terraform.tfvars (public info)
```

Outputs the two role ARNs:

```bash
terraform output deploy_role_arn_prod
terraform output deploy_role_arn_preview
```

Add both to **GitHub Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** as `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN_PROD` and `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN_PREVIEW`.

While you're in the GitHub Secrets UI, add the **build-input** secrets too. These are different from the role ARNs — they're inlined into the static SvelteKit build at compile time (Vite reads them from `apps/web/.env`, written by the workflow before `npm run build`):

| Secret name | Source | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project settings → API → URL | yes |
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase project settings → API keys → the **`sb_publishable_…`** key (the legacy `anon` JWT still works until legacy keys are disabled; NEVER a secret/`service_role` key) | yes |
| `PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY` | maptiler.com → Account → Keys | yes (maps don't render without it) |
| `PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_WEB_CHECKOUT_URL` | RevenueCat dashboard → Web Paywall Link (`https://pay.rev.cat/<token>`) | only when Pro is sellable — `PUBLIC_COACH_ENABLED` or `PUBLIC_ROUTE_GEN_ENABLED` truthy (the build guard enforces it then; with both flags unset — the rock-bottom tier — leave it unset too) |
| `PUBLIC_COACH_ENABLED` / `PUBLIC_ROUTE_GEN_ENABLED` | set `true` when the coach / route engines go live (decisions §204) | no — leave unset at rock-bottom; unset = Pro not sold, coach UI hidden |
| `PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_WEB_PORTAL_URL` | RevenueCat dashboard → customer portal link | optional (manage-subscription button degrades to a hint) |
| `PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | Sentry → Settings → Projects → Client Keys (DSN) | optional |

If a secret is unset, the workflow writes an empty string into `.env` and `svelte-check` errors with `Module '$env/static/public' has no exported member 'PUBLIC_X'`. Set the required three before the first deploy.

### 4. Preview env (apply first to flush out config issues against a non-prod blast radius)

```bash
cd ../envs/preview
# The canonical tfvars lives in the PRIVATE estate repo (plaintext — the values
# are non-secret: publishable key, public URLs, alert emails; the private repo
# keeps them off public GitHub and makes any workstation deploy-ready). Symlink
# it in; fall back to cp-from-example only if you're not using the estate repo.
ln -s ../../../../infra-secrets/threkir/preview.tfvars terraform.tfvars
$EDITOR terraform.tfvars                          # fill in supabase URL + anon key
terraform init
terraform apply
```

The first apply creates the KMS key, S3 bucket, CloudFront distribution, and Lambda **with a placeholder zip and no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** (because the secrets file doesn't exist yet). The coach endpoint will return 503 — that's expected. Static site already works.

> **Secrets live in the PRIVATE estate repo, NOT here.** This repo is PUBLIC.
> Production sops ciphertext is committed to `Absence0760/infra-secrets` (cloned
> as a sibling at `../infra-secrets`), under `threkir/<env>.sops.yaml` — never
> under `infra/` (a sops file in public history leaks KMS-ARN metadata + secret
> key names; `infra/.gitignore` blocks it as a fail-safe). The Terraform
> `sops_file` data source reads the external path via the `secrets_file` var
> (default `../infra-secrets/threkir/<env>.sops.yaml`); set `TF_VAR_secrets_file`
> if your estate clone lives elsewhere. See [decisions.md §53](../docs/architecture/decisions.md) and `infra/.sops.yaml`.

The scripted path does the rest (`bin/sops-init.sh` wires the env's KMS ARN into the estate `.sops.yaml` and seeds the encrypted file; `bin/secret-set.sh` writes a key). The equivalent manual steps for preview:

```bash
ARN=$(terraform output -raw kms_key_arn)                       # from infra/envs/preview
cd ../../../../infra-secrets                                   # the private estate repo
$EDITOR .sops.yaml                                             # set `kms:` on the ^threkir/preview\.sops\.yaml$ rule to $ARN
mkdir -p threkir
echo 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: sk-ant-...' > /tmp/coach.yaml
echo 'SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY: sb_secret_...' >> /tmp/coach.yaml   # coach assistant-message persistence (XSS audit H1); without it the coach streams but doesn't save replies. Use the sb_secret_… key (decisions §280), not the legacy service_role JWT
echo 'SENTRY_DSN: ...' >> /tmp/coach.yaml      # optional
sops --config "$PWD/.sops.yaml" --filename-override "$PWD/threkir/preview.sops.yaml" --output threkir/preview.sops.yaml --encrypt /tmp/coach.yaml   # sops picks the rule by the INPUT's name, so name the target, in full
shred -u /tmp/coach.yaml
git add threkir/preview.sops.yaml .sops.yaml && git commit -m 'threkir: preview secrets'   # commit in the PRIVATE repo
```

Re-apply (back in `infra/envs/preview`) to wire the secrets into the Lambda:

```bash
cd -    # back to infra/envs/preview
terraform apply
```

The apply encrypts the credential half of the file into
`aws_kms_ciphertext.coach` / `aws_kms_ciphertext.generate_route` and puts those
blobs — not the keys — in the two functions' environments. Re-run it after every
`bin/secret-set.sh`: the blob is a resource, so a changed plaintext is a changed
blob, and a function still holding the old one decrypts the old value.

### 5. Prod env

> **Scripted path:** `bin/deploy-prod.sh` runs the same orchestrated chain as
> `deploy-preview.sh` (idempotent — the shared bootstrap / dns / github-oidc
> stacks no-op, only `infra/envs/prod` applies) and prints the exact phase-2
> secret-wiring commands. The manual steps below are the equivalent.

> **Fresh AWS account?** The default Lambda concurrent-executions quota is 10, which rejects
> the module's reserved-concurrency caps outright. Request the raise to 1000 before this
> apply and/or set the two `*_reserved_concurrency = -1` tfvars overrides while it's pending —
> full recipe in [deployment_lean.md § Rock-bottom deploy steps](../docs/ops/deployment_lean.md#rock-bottom-deploy-steps).

Same flow, in `envs/prod/` (ciphertext → `../infra-secrets/threkir/prod.sops.yaml`):

```bash
cd ../prod
ln -s ../../../../infra-secrets/threkir/prod.tfvars terraform.tfvars   # canonical copy in the estate repo (see § 4)
$EDITOR terraform.tfvars
terraform init
terraform apply
ARN=$(terraform output -raw kms_key_arn)
( cd ../../../../infra-secrets
  $EDITOR .sops.yaml                                           # set `kms:` on the ^threkir/prod\.sops\.yaml$ rule to $ARN
  mkdir -p threkir
  echo 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: sk-ant-...' > /tmp/coach.yaml
  echo 'SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY: sb_secret_...' >> /tmp/coach.yaml   # coach assistant-message persistence (XSS audit H1)
  sops --config "$PWD/.sops.yaml" --filename-override "$PWD/threkir/prod.sops.yaml" --output threkir/prod.sops.yaml --encrypt /tmp/coach.yaml
  shred -u /tmp/coach.yaml
  git add threkir/prod.sops.yaml .sops.yaml && git commit -m 'threkir: prod secrets' )
terraform apply
```

### 6. First code deploy

Push a no-op commit to `main` (or push a `web@*` tag for prod) — `.github/workflows/release-web.yml` builds the Lambda zip + the SvelteKit static build, OIDC-assumes the deploy role, and uploads everything. Watch the run at https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/actions.

If the workflow fails with `Could not load credentials from any providers` on the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` step, the GitHub secret for that env's role ARN is missing — re-check step 3.

If it fails on `npm run check` with `Module '$env/static/public' has no exported member 'PUBLIC_X'`, the corresponding `PUBLIC_*` GitHub secret from step 3 is missing.

Once green: visit `preview.<your-apex>` (or `<your-apex>` for prod) and confirm the SvelteKit static site renders.

## Rotation

Edit a secret in place (the encrypted file lives in the PRIVATE estate repo):

```bash
sops ../infra-secrets/threkir/prod.sops.yaml      # opens $EDITOR with decrypted YAML
( cd ../infra-secrets && git commit -am 'running: rotate prod secret' )   # commit in the private repo
cd infra/envs/prod && terraform apply             # publishes a new Lambda version with the new env
bin/lambda-alias-sync.sh prod                     # repoint the CI-owned `live` aliases so it actually serves
```

Or non-interactively for one specific key (no shell history leak — value comes via stdin / `--from-file`; `bin/secret-set.sh` writes to `../infra-secrets/threkir/<env>.sops.yaml`):

```bash
echo -n "$NEW_VALUE" | bin/secret-set.sh prod ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
( cd ../infra-secrets && git commit -am 'running: rotate ANTHROPIC_API_KEY' )
cd infra/envs/prod && terraform apply
bin/lambda-alias-sync.sh prod
```

If you ever change the *KMS key itself* (destroyed + recreated, or moved in the estate `.sops.yaml`), the existing encrypted file still decrypts under the OLD key in its metadata. Re-encrypt under the new key with [`bin/key-rotate.sh`](../bin/README.md). For *AWS-native key material* rotation (`aws kms enable-key-rotation`) no re-encrypt is needed — sops sees the same key alias.

**An env-only apply does not reach the serving path by itself** (issue #590 defect 2). The functions publish on every apply (`publish = true`), but the `live` aliases — which the Function URLs target — are CI-owned (`ignore_changes` in Terraform; `release-web.yml` repoints them on code deploys), so the apply's freshly published version sits unserved while the alias keeps the old version's frozen env snapshot. Run `bin/lambda-alias-sync.sh <env>` after the apply (or cut a release); it repoints each of the eight web Lambdas' `live` alias to its newest published version. In-flight requests finish on the old config; new requests pick up the new value within ~10 s of the repoint.

## State

Remote state in `s3://threkir-tfstate/`. Locking is S3-native via `use_lockfile = true` — Terraform writes a `.tflock` file alongside each state file, using S3's conditional-write `If-None-Match` semantics. No DynamoDB table to manage. The `bootstrap` stack itself uses local state (chicken-and-egg).

## Disaster recovery

If the AWS account itself is gone, see [`apps/web/deployment.md` § Disaster recovery](../apps/web/deployment.md#disaster-recovery) for the rebuild procedure. Important nuance: KMS keys can't be cross-account-recovered, so the existing `../infra-secrets/threkir/*.sops.yaml` ciphertext is unrecoverable in that scenario (the plaintext is gone with the key) — re-issue the secrets fresh and re-encrypt against the new env's KMS key. The private estate repo is the backup of record for the *encrypted* blobs, but it cannot rescue you from a lost KMS key.

For an interactive rebuild walkthrough that probes which phases are already done and resumes mid-flow, run [`bin/disaster-recovery.sh`](../bin/README.md) (or `bin/disaster-recovery.sh --status` for a read-only state check).

## What's NOT in here

- The CI deploy step itself (`.github/workflows/release-web.yml`) — that's a code-not-infra concern.
- The Lambda handler source — `apps/web/lambda/coach/`.
- Backend infra (Supabase, Fly.io worker + OSRM) — those have their own deploy plans under each `apps/<service>/deployment.md`.
