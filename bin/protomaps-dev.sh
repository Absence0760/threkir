# protomaps-dev.sh — local Protomaps tile server for dev.
#
# Eliminates the MapTiler dependency during development. Boots
# `tileserver-gl` (the full version, not -light) in Docker, points it
# at a PMTiles file containing OpenStreetMap-derived vector tiles, and
# exposes a single localhost endpoint that serves BOTH:
#
#   • MapLibre vector tiles + style.json (web app uses these)
#   • Server-rasterised PNG tiles (mobile + Wear OS use these)
#
# This is the dev path. The production migration to self-hosted
# Protomaps (S3 + PMTiles via Range requests) is a separate decision —
# see docs/architecture/decisions.md § 68 + docs/ops/protomaps_local_setup.md.
#
# Usage:
#   bin/protomaps-dev.sh fetch              # downloads a PMTiles file
#   bin/protomaps-dev.sh start              # boots the container
#   bin/protomaps-dev.sh restart            # stop + start (pick up new PMTiles)
#   bin/protomaps-dev.sh stop               # kills it
#   bin/protomaps-dev.sh status             # is it running?
#   bin/protomaps-dev.sh logs               # tail the container logs
#   bin/protomaps-dev.sh env                # print the .env.local overrides
#
# Important: this script does NOT auto-download a PMTiles file.
# Protomaps publishes daily WORLD builds (~80GB) — not per-region
# pre-builds — at https://build.protomaps.com/<YYYYMMDD>.pmtiles.
# For dev you either:
#
#   (a) Run `bin/protomaps-dev.sh fetch` which downloads a small
#       sample (US states, ~1MB) — enough to verify the wire end
#       to end, not enough to render real run locations.
#   (b) Generate a regional extract from the daily world build
#       using the `pmtiles` Go CLI:
#         pmtiles extract https://build.protomaps.com/$(date +%Y%m%d).pmtiles \
#           ~/.cache/protomaps-dev/world.pmtiles --bbox=...
#   (c) Provide your own .pmtiles file at $PROTOMAPS_HOME/world.pmtiles
#       and point PMTILES_FILE at it.
#
