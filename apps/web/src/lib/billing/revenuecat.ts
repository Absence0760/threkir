/// RevenueCat hosted-checkout wrapper.
///
/// Pro checkout and subscription management both run through RevenueCat's
/// HOSTED redirect surfaces — a Web Paywall Link for purchase and the
/// no-code customer portal for management — rather than the embedded
/// `@revenuecat/purchases-js` SDK. The SDK shipped ~178 KB gzipped into
/// the `/settings/upgrade` bundle for two one-shot redirects; a hosted
/// link does the same job with zero client JS. See
/// docs/features/paywall.md § "Client → RevenueCat SDK" + decisions.md.
///
/// The CTA on `/settings/upgrade` calls `proCheckoutUrl()`; if the link
/// isn't configured (local dev, previews, CI), the wrapper reports
/// `configured = false` and the caller falls back to a "coming soon"
/// toast. Keeps the settings page usable end-to-end without a real RC
/// account.
///
/// Production flow:
///   1. The buyer is redirected to the Web Paywall Link with their
///      Supabase user id appended, so RevenueCat keys the purchase to the
///      same identity the webhook sees (`app_user_id`).
///   2. On success RevenueCat redirects back to `/settings/upgrade`; the
///      `revenuecat-webhook` Edge Function flips `subscription_tier`
///      server-side, and the page refetches the profile on load.
///   3. Management routes to the hosted customer portal (active-sub
///      lookup by email), so no per-user SDK `getCustomerInfo()` call is
///      needed to derive a management URL.
///
/// URL construction lives in the `$env`-free `revenuecat_links.ts` so it
/// stays unit-testable; this module is the thin env-reading shell.
