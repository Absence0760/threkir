//! Breadcrumb course following + off-course detection.
//!
//! The fifth parity port: the projection math mirrors the main app's
//! `route_snap.ts` `snapToPolyline` (web canonical, the nearest perpendicular
//! foot on the closest segment — not merely the nearest vertex — in a local
//! equirectangular frame per segment) and its along-course accumulation, the
//! same shape `route_geometry.ts` `distanceAlongRoute` resolves for the
//! predictive-live-tracking input. The off-course detector reproduces the
//! mobile run screen's route-overlay behaviour: alert past 40 m, re-arm only
//! once back within half that, so the boundary can't flap an alert on GPS
//! jitter. Tests mirror `route_snap.test.ts` + the `distanceAlongRoute` cases
//! in `route_geometry.test.ts` case-for-case, plus firmware-specific ones.
//!
//! [`Course::project_from`] layers a watch-local forward-progress bias on top
//! of that ported geometry so along-course distance stays monotonic-friendly
//! on a retracing course (out-and-back / lollipop / parallel legs) instead of
//! collapsing onto the outbound leg on the return — it is NOT part of the
//! `snapToPolyline` parity port; the plain `project` math is left untouched.
//!
//! Two further watch-local departures from the port. The per-segment frame and
//! the panel fit take their longitude differences through [`crate::geo`], so a
//! course straddling 180 deg projects onto itself instead of ~40,000 km away —
//! the web original has the same defect and is not fixed here (its own bug, its
//! own lockstep). And [`Course::is_loop`] closes the along-axis into a circle on
//! a course whose ends meet, which web has no concept of at all. Both are
//! additive: on a course that neither straddles the line nor closes, every
//! value is what the port produced, bit for bit.
//!
//! [`PanelFit`] is the display half kept host-testable: it fits the course's
//! bounding box into a pixel panel (longitude scaled by cos(mid-latitude), the
//! same correction `track_projection.ts` applies so a square loop renders
//! square) and maps lat/lon to pixel coordinates; the app's ui task only blits
//! lines between the points this module hands it.
