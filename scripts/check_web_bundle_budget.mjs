// Guardrail: the web bundle's ceilings measure what one reader downloads, and
// a translation is not a dep.
//
// This job summed every emitted JS+CSS file into one number. That is the right
// arithmetic for a dependency — code-splitting a library must not lower the
// total, or the gate rewards moving weight around instead of removing it — and
// the wrong arithmetic for a message catalogue. The six non-default catalogues
// are `import()`ed one at a time by `i18n/store.svelte.ts`; a German reader
// fetches `de` and never the other five. Summing them charges every reader for
// bytes only one language's readers ever request, so the ceiling had to climb
// once per language: pt-PT (§ 755) moved the total 2376 -> 2462 and forced
// 2400 -> 2700 while the largest chunk stayed byte-identical, i.e. the gate
// fired on a change that moved no reader's payload at all. Each language after
// that buys the next rogue dep another ~88 KB of cover.
//
// So the emitted files are split into two populations with a budget each:
//
//   MAX_CODE_KB           everything a reader downloads regardless of language.
//   MAX_CATALOGUE_KB      per catalogue, NOT summed — this is the number that
//                         must not move when a language is added.
//   MAX_LARGEST_CHUNK_KB  the largest single CODE chunk, catalogues excluded:
//                         a catalogue is already its own lazy chunk and cannot
//                         be split further, so it is governed by its own
//                         ceiling and by nothing else.
//   MAX_ASSET_KB          per emitted file that is neither JS nor CSS — a font,
//                         an icon, a prerendered page, the manifest — and, like
//                         a catalogue, never summed.
//
// The asset ceiling closes a hole the other three could not see. The walk
// matched `*.js` and `*.css` only, so everything else the build emits was
// outside the metric entirely: measured, 33 files and 4058 KB gzipped, of which
// ONE file was 3866 KB — the unsubsetted `material-symbols-outlined.woff2`,
// declared `font-display: block` in the ROOT layout's stylesheet, so it was
// blocking weight for every reader and 1.8x the whole code ceiling. It shipped
// for one measurement under a named exemption rather than being absorbed,
// because a ceiling that would admit it silently admits the next one too, and
// the exemption is now gone: the font is subset to the icons the app names
// (decisions § 780) and clears the same 100 KB every other asset is held to.
// ASSET_EXEMPTIONS is deliberately left in place and EMPTY — the arithmetic it
// carries is worth keeping, and an empty list is the honest statement that
// nothing currently needs covering.
//
// Per file and never summed is the right arithmetic here for the catalogues'
// reason: a reader loads ONE prerendered page, ONE favicon. That also answers
// the question this population was added for — whether prerendered HTML needs a
// budget. It does, and this is it: 16 HTML files today (15 of them under
// `/learn`), 71 KB gzipped in total, largest 5 KB. A per-locale prerender of
// `/learn` would multiply the file count and move no ceiling, exactly as a
// seventh language moves no catalogue ceiling. (The filing that asked for this
// assumed the 8 guides already prerendered once per language; they do not —
// prose localization has not shipped, and the tree holds one language's HTML.)
//
// The English catalogue is deliberately on the CODE side, and that is not an
// accounting convenience. `store.svelte.ts` imports it statically as the
// synchronous fallback dict (`dict[key] ?? en[key] ?? key`), so rollup emits it
// inside the shared store chunk that every reader downloads before any locale
// is negotiated. Every non-English reader therefore downloads TWO catalogues,
// not one. It is a real unconditional cost, it belongs in the number that
// tracks unconditional cost, and it is why exactly one locale is expected to be
// absent from the manifest below.
//
// Classification comes from vite's client manifest, not from a filename
// pattern. Client chunks are content-hashed (`chunks/3HhVpFjz.js`) and carry no
// name at all, so a pattern could only guess; the manifest states which emitted
// file each `src/lib/i18n/locales/<tag>.ts` became. It also makes the guard
// fail on the interesting drift rather than silently absorb it: a catalogue
// that stops being its own chunk disappears from the manifest, and the count
// check below names the locale instead of letting ~88 KB land in the code
// budget under a message about deps.
//
// Ceilings, and the measurements behind them (2026-08-28, gzip via node:zlib):
//   code 1934 KB across 403 files, largest code chunk 245 KB
//   catalogues 522 KB across 6 — de 88, es 85, fr 88, ja 91, pt-BR 85, pt-PT 85
//   total 2456 KB (the retired single ceiling was 2700)
// Re-measured 2026-09-18 (gzip via node:zlib, production build of apps/web):
//   code 2103 KB across 431 files, largest code chunk 274 KB
//   catalogues 597 KB across 6 — de 101, es 98, fr 101, ja 103, pt-BR 97, pt-PT 97
// Note for whoever reads this next: MAX_CODE_KB is unchanged at 2120 and the
// code population now measures 2103, so that ceiling carries 17 KB of cover
// rather than the 186 KB it was set with. It is not moved here because this
// change does not trip it and a ceiling raised pre-emptively protects nothing,
// but the next dep of any size will fire it, and the route-scoped-catalogue
// work below is what would give it room back (the English catalogue is inside
// this population, by design, and grew with the rest).
// MAX_CODE_KB is 2120: ~9.6% headroom over 1934, the same convention the four
// bumps this file replaces used (2026-06-10, 06-20, 07-11, 07-27), now applied
// to a base that no longer carries 522 KB no browser fetches together. Against
// the old rule that is 238 KB of cover for a rogue dep cut to 186 KB, and —
// the point — it stays 186 KB however many languages ship.
// MAX_CATALOGUE_KB is 115, re-measured 2026-09-18: ~10% over the largest
// catalogue (ja, 104 KB in CI / 103 locally). It moves when the KEY COUNT
// grows, which is payload growth for every reader, and never when the locale
// count grows, which is payload growth for none — and this is the first time
// the first clause has been exercised, so it is worth recording what moved it
// rather than only that it moved. Issue #905 workstream 5 put a one-line plain
// explanation under every control on fifteen more surfaces, which is +98 keys
// in every locale: de 96 -> 101, fr 95 -> 101, ja 98 -> 104, es/pt-BR/pt-PT
// 92 -> 97/98. The guard asked the right question in its failure message —
// key count, or something that is not translated text? — and the answer is
// measurably the former, 98 translated sentences.
//
// Raising it is the honest outcome for growth that is deliberate, and it is
// NOT the durable answer to what the measurement exposes: the catalogue is one
// chunk per locale, so sentences that only ever render on the club / event /
// race / challenge / fundraiser / gym / session editors are downloaded by
// every reader of that language, and the English copies ride the code bundle
// for every reader on earth. Route-scoped catalogues are the fix; they are
// blocked on `store.svelte.ts`'s synchronous `dict[key] ?? en[key] ?? key`
// contract, so they are a piece of work rather than a line, and they are filed
// in `followups.md` rather than smuggled into the PR that tripped this.
// MAX_LARGEST_CHUNK_KB stays 350, unchanged: 245 KB * the 33% headroom that
// number was always justified by is 326, so the existing figure still states
// the rule. What changed is the population it measures, not the ceiling.
// MAX_ASSET_KB is 100, the same per-file payload figure as a catalogue: ~35%
// over the largest asset (the subset font, 74 KB) and 20x over the largest
// prerendered page (5 KB). Assets re-measured after subsetting: 33 files and
// 266 KB gzipped in total (was 4058) — font 74 KB, icon-512 68, og-default 20,
// icon-192 11, apple-touch-icon 10, then the 16 HTML pages at 5 KB and below
// and everything else at 1.
//
// Run: `node scripts/check_web_bundle_budget.mjs` (after a production build of
//      apps/web — it reads build output, it does not produce any).
// CI:  the `build-web` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml, which is in the
//      `CI gate` aggregator's `needs:` list (decisions § 775).
