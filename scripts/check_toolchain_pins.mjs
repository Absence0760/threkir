// Guardrail: every toolchain the build installs is pinned, and every workflow
// installs the same one. Two toolchains, checked with the same policy but
// against different sources of truth:
//
//   Flutter — every `subosito/flutter-action` step pins an explicit version,
//     and all of them agree with each other. There is no in-repo file that
//     resolves the SDK, so the workflows ARE the source of truth.
//   melos  — every `dart pub global activate melos` pins a version, and all of
//     them agree with `pubspec.lock`. Here a source of truth DOES exist, so
//     the workflows are checked against it rather than against each other:
//     `pub global activate` ignores the workspace entirely, so without this
//     CI can run a different melos than `dart run melos` resolves locally.
//     This mirrors check_watch_ble_uuids.mjs, which reads the firmware's own
//     table rather than transcribing it.
//   defmt-print — every `cargo install defmt-print` pins an EXACT version (no
//     caret or range), all of them agree, and each one's `actions/cache` key
//     carries that same version. Like Flutter and unlike melos, no in-repo
//     file resolves it: it is a host-side CLI, not a firmware dependency, so
//     it is absent from apps/custom_watch/Cargo.lock and self-consistency is
//     the honest ceiling. The cache-key half is not decoration — the install
//     step is `command -v defmt-print || cargo install ...`, so a cache key
//     that does not move when the version does would keep restoring the old
//     binary and the pin would never run. That is not hypothetical: under the
//     old `^1.1` the key was `defmt-print-1.1-<os>` and never changed, so CI
//     had been serving a cached binary whose provenance the config could not
//     express (run 31623789083 shows the cache hit and `command -v` winning,
//     with `cargo install` never executing).
//
// Why this exists: decisions.md § 595. Each of those steps was SHA-pinned but
// took only `channel: stable`, so the SDK itself floated. Flutter 3.47.0
// (Dart 3.13) published 51 minutes after main's last green run, the next PR
// inherited it, and two new `unawaited_return_in_try_block` warnings failed
// `dart analyze` on code nobody had touched — pointing the blame at that PR
// rather than at the toolchain that moved underneath it.
//
// The version now lives in each workflow's top-level `env.FLUTTER_VERSION`.
// That dedupes the six call sites inside ci.yml, but a workflow-level `env`
// is per-FILE — it cannot span ci.yml, release-android.yml and release-ios.yml,
// and those three must agree or a release binary is built on an SDK that CI
// never validated. A composite action would have collapsed all three to one
// literal, but Dependabot's github-actions ecosystem only scans
// `.github/workflows` plus a ROOT `action.yml`, so moving the pinned
// `subosito/flutter-action@<sha>` into `.github/actions/` would have quietly
// ended SHA updates for it. Three declarations plus this check keeps both
// properties.
//
//   Node — every `actions/setup-node` step names a `node-version`, all of them
//     agree, and the version is an EXACT `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` rather than a bare
//     major. Same shape as Flutter and for the same reason: no in-repo file
//     resolves the runtime, so the workflows ARE the source of truth, and a
//     release built on a Node that CI never ran is an untested binary. A step
//     with no `node-version` at all is the `channel: stable` shape one more
//     time — it takes whatever the runner image ships that week, and so did a
//     bare `24`, which is why `release-web.yml` built the shipped bundle on
//     whichever 24.x the runner resolved that morning (decisions § 1214).
//     The exactness clause is the one this paragraph asserted for four rounds
//     while no code read it: § 1214 moved 22 steps to `24.20.0` by hand and
//     left the rule to a sentence, so a sweep back to `24` would have passed —
//     every step naming a version, all agreeing, and `.tool-versions` saying
//     `nodejs 24` comparing equal to it (decisions § 1502).
//
//   Deno — every `denoland/setup-deno` step names a `deno-version`, all of them
//     agree, and the version is an EXACT `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` rather than a
//     channel. Both steps took `v2.x`, which is the same shape as `channel:
//     stable` and the Rust `stable` § 705 closed: a Deno release lands, `deno
//     check` or `deno test` gains a diagnostic, and CI fails on code nobody
//     touched with the blame landing on whichever PR ran next. Those two steps
//     are the whole Deno rail — the `parity-types` deno.lock guard and the
//     `edge-functions` job — and there is no in-repo file that resolves the
//     runtime, so as with Flutter and Node the workflows ARE the source of
//     truth and `.tool-versions` is checked against them.
//
//   The developer toolchain — `.tool-versions`, the file a contributor points
//     `asdf install` / `mise install` at. Every line in it, ACTIVE OR
//     COMMENTED, is compared against the pin the repo enforces for that
//     toolchain, because a commented pin is a claim the next reader will
//     uncomment (the § 711 reasoning about a commented action pin). Nothing
//     read this file, and it pinned `nodejs 22` while all 21 setup-node steps
//     ran 24 (decisions § 911).
//
//   Rust (firmware) — `apps/custom_watch/rust-toolchain.toml` names an EXACT
//     `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` channel, never `stable`/`beta`/`nightly` and never a
//     two-component `1.98`. The firmware job runs clippy with `-D warnings`
//     across three feature sets, and a zero-warning bar on a floating channel
//     hands the toolchain vendor the power to break the build on whoever
//     pushes next: clippy 1.98 added `chunks_exact_to_as_chunks` and failed CI
//     on two call sites untouched for weeks, from a PR changing docs
//     (decisions.md § 705). Same rule, same reason, as the Flutter pin — and
//     it was the one toolchain in this repo that nothing checked.
//
//   GitHub Actions — every `uses:` reference naming a third-party action pins
//     a 40-character commit SHA and carries the trailing `# vN` comment that
//     makes it readable (conventions.md § GitHub Actions). A tag is mutable:
//     the publisher can move `@v1` onto anything, and it then runs with this
//     repo's GITHUB_TOKEN. Local `uses: ./…` references are the repo's own
//     files and need no pin.
//
//     **Commented-out lines are read too**, and that is the point rather than
//     an edge case. `apple-actions/upload-testflight-build@v1` sat on a
//     mutable tag inside release-ios.yml's commented TestFlight block through
//     the whole pin sweep that moved every live reference to a SHA — written
//     off as dead code precisely because nothing looked at it. It is not
//     dead; it is what someone uncomments on the day they first ship to
//     TestFlight. A guard that skips comments would have re-created the
//     blind spot it exists to close.
//
// The vacuous-pass case is checked for all of them: if the action is renamed,
// or the activate line reworded, this fails rather than reporting success over
// an empty set. A guard that inspects nothing enforces nothing.
//
// Run: `node scripts/check_toolchain_pins.mjs`
// CI:  the `workflow-lint` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml, which is in the
//      `CI gate` aggregator's `needs:` list.
