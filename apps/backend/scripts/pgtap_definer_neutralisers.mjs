// Permissive replacements for the relations that filter in their OWN SQL.
//
// The sibling guard's first operator widens row-level security for the span of
// one assertion. That reaches the whole of the mechanism behind a base table
// read - but a `security definer` view and a SECURITY DEFINER function already
// run as their owner, so RLS was never what was hiding anything from them. They
// filter in their own WHERE. Widening RLS leaves their result identical, so
// every refusal assertion that reads only through one would "survive" for a
// reason that says nothing about the assertion.
//
// The operator for that class is a permissive replacement per relation:
// `create or replace` the view or function, inside a savepoint, with the same
// signature and projection and WITHOUT the predicates that decide whether the
// caller may see the rows. The savepoint is rolled back after the assertion,
// so the real definition is restored before the next one runs.
//
// The line every replacement is drawn on, and the reason a false KILL is the
// dangerous direction here:
//
//   Keep every predicate that says WHICH rows the assertion is asking about -
//   the arguments, the join keys, the subject's own identity. Drop every
//   predicate that says WHETHER THE CALLER MAY SEE THEM - ownership, consent,
//   opt-in, blocks, shadow-hiding, the minor floor, `is_*_visible_to`.
//
// Dropping too little leaves the mutation inert, and an inert mutation makes a
// good assertion look vacuous - loud, and safe. Dropping a SUBJECT SELECTOR
// instead reveals rows the assertion never asked about, which makes a VACUOUS
// assertion look good - silent, and the exact false green the guard exists to
// find. So each entry also carries a witness: a subject the real relation
// provably hides, which the replacement must provably reveal. A replacement
// that reveals nothing is reported as an instrument failure rather than
// trusted, because §741's lesson is that a mutation operator is only as honest
// as what it is run against.

// Every entry: `sql` is the replacement, `why` names the access control it
// drops, `subject` names the relation its revealed rows come from, and
// `witness` proves the replacement has teeth. `witness.setup` makes a subject
// the real relation must hide; `witness.probe` counts that subject through the
// relation and must read 0 before the replacement and more than 0 after.

// Restrict a replacement to the rows THIS transaction wrote.
//
// A permissive replacement drops the predicate that decides whether the caller
// may see a row - so it reveals every row in the table, not only the one the
// test filed. Where the assertion's own selector is narrow enough to name the
// test's subject that is the same thing, and where it is not it is emphatically
// not: `gym_exercise_set_history('Bench Press')` normalises the name, and
// seed.sql commits six `Bench press` sets, so the mutation kills that assertion
// whether or not the test inserted anything at all. The kill would then say a
// subject exists in the database rather than that the test built one, which is
// § 741's inversion one remove further out - deterministic here, because the
// seed is committed and reproducible, but still a subject the test did not file.
//
// `xmin` is the handle, and it is sound only when it is pointed at the right
// relation: not the one carrying the access control that was dropped, but the
// one the replacement's rows COME FROM. For `public_run_gear` those are
// different tables - the predicate dropped is a visibility check on `runs`,
// while the rows returned are `run_gear` joined to `gear` - and scoping the
// access-controlled table would restrict nothing the caller ever sees. So each
// entry names its own alias, beside the `why` that names what it drops.
//
// An UPDATE writes a new row version, so a test that establishes its subject by
// mutating a seed row ("make this profile shadow-hidden") is transaction-local
// too. What is left outside is a row the test only ever SELECTed, which is
// exactly the exposure.
//
// § 751 spelled the test `xmin = pg_current_xact_id()::xid` and recorded what
// that misses: pgtap's `lives_ok` and `throws_ok` run their payload in a
// SUBtransaction, so a fixture filed the idiomatic pgtap way carries the
// subtransaction's xid and reads as foreign. It called that the safe direction -
// the mutation goes inert, the assertion survives and the guard reports it by
// name rather than passing it silently - and so it is, but it is still a wrong
// answer, and operator 1's population is full of them: three of
// `public_recaps_rls_test`'s refusals rest on one `lives_ok(... update ...)`.
//
// It also recorded why the exact test was out of reach: `pg_xact_status` is
// superuser-only and these predicates run as `authenticated`. A SECURITY DEFINER
// wrapper owned by `postgres` is the answer to that, and it makes the test exact
// rather than approximate. Given a row the caller can already SEE, an xmin still
// IN PROGRESS can only be this transaction's own - every other in-progress
// transaction's rows are invisible under MVCC - so "visible and in progress" is
// precisely "written here", subtransactions included.
//
// `pg_xact_status` takes an xid8 and `xmin` is a bare 32-bit xid, so the epoch
// has to be put back: `c - c::xid` is the current xid8 less its own low 32 bits.
// Anything this transaction wrote shares that epoch, because a wraparound needs
// 2^32 transactions. The `w >= c` guard is what keeps the reconstruction honest:
// an xid older than ours may be from an earlier epoch and may have had its clog
// truncated, and it is never one of ours, so it is answered without asking.
