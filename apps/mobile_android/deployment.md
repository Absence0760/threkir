# Mobile Android deployment plan

How `apps/mobile_android/` ships to the Google Play Store.

Operational counterpart of [`apps/mobile_android/CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) (stack, what's real, file layout) and [`apps/mobile_android/local_testing.md`](local_testing.md) (running it locally). For tag-driven release mechanics see [`docs/ops/releasing.md`](../../docs/ops/releasing.md). For the cross-service overview see [`docs/ops/deployment.md`](../../docs/ops/deployment.md).

**Status: plan.** Local builds + tests pass; no Play listing exists yet.

---

## Provider — Google Play Console

**Track strategy:**

```
Internal track  → Closed alpha (10–100 testers)  → Closed beta (1k+ testers)  → Production
   ↑ workflow                                                                       ↑ manual
   tag-driven                                                                  Play Console
```

The release workflow always lands at the **Internal track**. Manual promotion to Beta / Production happens in the Play Console after a smoke test. This is intentional: tagging `mobile_android@1.2.3` should never reach unsuspecting users without a human checking the build first.

**Application ID:** `com.threkir.app` (or whatever the brand picks). Don't change this after the first published release — every existing install becomes orphaned.

**Country / region rollout:** start with **UK + Australia** (where most early users live). Once stable, widen to "all countries". Some regulated markets (China, Russia) require additional legal work — leave them off until that work is scoped.

## One-time Play Console setup

1. **Pay the $25 developer registration fee.** One time, per Google account. **The login identity is a dedicated Gmail** (e.g. `threkir.app@gmail.com`), **not** a branded `@threkir.com` address — see § Account identity below for why. Set the Play Console *contact* addresses to `google@` / `support@` / `privacy@threkir.com` so the domain still shows up on the operator-facing side.
2. **Create the app.** Play Console → Create app. Name, default language (en-GB), Type: App, Free.
3. **Fill the Store listing.** Short description, long description, screenshots (need at least 2 phone screenshots, 1 7"+ tablet, 1 10"+ tablet for newer Play guidelines), feature graphic (1024×500 PNG — committed at `assets/feature-graphic.png`, regenerate from the SVG source with `assets/gen-feature-graphic.sh`), app icon (512×512 PNG).
4. **Privacy policy URL.** Required for any app that touches location. Host at `threkir.com/privacy` — see § Privacy policy below.
5. **App content questionnaire.** Click through every "Privacy", "Ads", "Target audience", "Data safety" form. **Data safety is non-trivial** — see § Data safety below.
6. **App access.** Provide test credentials (`runner@test.com` / `testtest` against a *staging* Supabase project — never production seed). The Play review team uses these to access functionality behind sign-in.
7. **Content rating.** Complete the IARC questionnaire. Running app should land at "Everyone".
8. **Pricing & distribution.** Free, available in target countries.
9. **Set up the "Internal testing" track.** Add at least 1 internal tester email so the link is live.

## Account identity — dedicated Gmail login, threkir.com contact addresses

**Decided 2026-07-12.** The Google account that owns Play Console (and later the
linked GCP project for the release service account + Firebase for FCM push) uses
a **dedicated Gmail as the login identity** (e.g. `threkir.app@gmail.com`).
`@threkir.com` addresses are used only as the **contact / notification
addresses** configured inside each Google product.

Why not a branded `@threkir.com` login:

- A real `@threkir.com` Google *login* requires **paid Google Workspace**
  (~$7/user/mo). Google's "create account with existing email" path has been
  removed for personal accounts, and "For work or my business" funnels straight
  into the Workspace signup.
- Worse, the Workspace signup wants to **take over `threkir.com` email** (own the
  MX, route mail through Gmail) — which **collides with the Migadu inbound setup**
  (the apex MX/SPF/DKIM in `infra/dns/terraform.tfvars` `email_auth_records`).
  Adopting Workspace would mean migrating mail off Migadu. Not worth it just to
  own a Play Console account.
- A Gmail login is cosmetic-only: all operational contact + notification mail
  still flows to the Migadu inbox via the `@threkir.com` contact addresses,
  nothing touches the MX, and it's free. It also avoids gating account creation
  on `@threkir.com` receiving working (Gmail verifies against itself).

Treat the Gmail as a **role identity**, not a person: two admins on the Play
Console, 2FA enabled, and **2FA backup codes printed** (see § Disaster recovery
→ Lost Play Console access). If real `@threkir.com` Google logins are ever
wanted, that's a deliberate "adopt Workspace + migrate mail off Migadu" project,
not a default.

## Signing setup

The release workflow signs every `.aab` with an upload key stored as a GitHub Secret. The Play Console then re-signs with Play App Signing's distribution key — that key never leaves Google.

A consequence worth knowing before anyone offers an APK from the website: **no artifact this repo builds can ever carry the signature an installed Play build expects.** The only signature-compatible download is the universal APK Play itself generates, pulled from the Play Console's App Bundle Explorer. See [decisions.md § 379](../../docs/architecture/decisions.md) for why we keep the app signing key with Google and what that means for direct distribution.

### Generate the upload keystore (one-time)

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore upload-keystore.jks -alias upload \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -dname "CN=Runonward, O=Runonward, L=London, ST=England, C=GB"

# Encode for GitHub Secret:
base64 -w0 -i upload-keystore.jks | xclip -selection clipboard

# Back the original .jks up (see below) — losing it means losing the
# ability to push updates. The Play Console's "Reset upload key"
# flow exists but it's a multi-day process; treat the .jks as
# irreplaceable.
```

**Canonical backup: the private estate secrets repo** (`Absence0760/infra-secrets`, cloned as a sibling at `../infra-secrets`) at `threkir/android-upload-keystore.sops.yaml` — the `.jks` (base64), the key alias, and both passwords, sops-encrypted under the threkir prod web-stack KMS key (access = IAM `kms:Decrypt`, backed up 2026-07-21 and verified byte-identical). The GitHub Secret is a **signing copy, not a backup**: GitHub secrets are write-only, so CI can sign with it forever but nobody can ever read the keystore back out. The release operator's workstation holds a working copy of the `.jks`.

Restore after a lost workstation:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=threkir sops --decrypt --extract '["keystore_jks_base64"]' ../infra-secrets/threkir/android-upload-keystore.sops.yaml | base64 -d > upload-keystore.jks
```

The passwords live in the same file (`sops ../infra-secrets/threkir/android-upload-keystore.sops.yaml` to view), and in the owner's Bitwarden.

### GitHub Secrets required

| Secret | Source |
|---|---|
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | base64 of `upload-keystore.jks` |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | from `keytool -genkey` |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | `upload` (matches `-alias` above) |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | from `keytool -genkey` (often same as keystore password) |
| `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | Play service account key JSON (next section) |

### Play service account (one-time)

Lets the workflow upload an `.aab` without a human in the loop:

1. Play Console → Setup → API access → "Choose a project to link" → create a Google Cloud project.
2. Create a service account in the Cloud Console (IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → Create).
3. Skip granting Cloud roles; we only need Play permissions.
4. Back in the Play Console → grant the service account "Release manager" role on **this app**.
5. Generate a JSON key for the service account (Service Accounts → … → Manage keys → Add key → JSON).
6. Paste the entire JSON into the GitHub Secret `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`.

The same service account JSON is reusable for the Wear OS release ([`apps/watch_wear/deployment.md`](../watch_wear/deployment.md)) — just grant it Release manager on that app too.

---

## Build configuration

### Single build, config by `--dart-define`

There are **no product flavours** — one `applicationId` (`com.threkir.app`), one build. The release build carries no `.env` config: `main.dart` gates the `.env.development` asset load behind `kDebugMode` (decisions §137), so a release APK **only** sees config passed as compile-time `--dart-define`s. The workflow writes an empty `.env.development` (the pubspec ships it as an asset, so the file must exist, but its contents are never read in release) and injects the values below.

Local dev is the mirror image: `flutter run` (debug) reads `apps/mobile_android/.env.development` from the bundle; per-machine overrides go through `--dart-define`, not a `.env.local`.

### Production config injected at build time

Each define is passed from a GitHub Secret; `main.dart`'s `String.fromEnvironment` block seeds every non-empty one into `dotenv`. **Leave a secret unset to keep that feature fail-closed.**

**Shared values reuse the canonical `PUBLIC_*` secrets the web + Wear OS releases already inject** — one prod source of truth, nothing to re-paste for these:

| Secret (already set) | Define | Value / effect |
|---|---|---|
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | `SUPABASE_URL` | prod Supabase URL — **required** |
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | publishable key — **required** |
| `PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY` | `MAPTILER_KEY` | MapTiler key — **required** (no maps without it) |
| `PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | `SENTRY_DSN` | Sentry DSN; empty → Sentry off |

`WEB_BASE_URL` is passed as a literal `https://threkir.com` in the build step (public host, not a secret).

**Mobile-specific secrets — create these:**

| Secret | Define | Value / effect |
|---|---|---|
| `MOBILE_OSRM_URL` | `OSRM_URL` | **Required for road-snapping**, and must be a URL the *device* can reach over the public internet. Note the internal `osrm.threkir.com` (Fly 6PN, never publicly resolvable — see `docs/ops/deployment.md`) does **not** work here: web reaches OSRM through the server-side `osrm-proxy` Lambda, but mobile's `routing.dart` calls OSRM directly. So this needs either OSRM exposed on a public, rate-limited hostname, or a mobile-facing proxy mirroring `apps/web/lambda/osrm-proxy`. Unset (or unreachable), the release build refuses the public demo (no DPA) and the route builder's Trail/Road modes degrade to straight-line placement (pins land where you tap) with a one-time disclosure. |
| `MOBILE_LIVE_HUB_URL` | `LIVE_HUB_URL` | Go live-hub URL; empty → falls back to Supabase `live_run_pings` |
| `MOBILE_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` | `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` | Google Sign-In web client id; empty → Google button no-ops |
| `MOBILE_STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` | `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` | Strava OAuth client id; empty → connect falls back to the web flow |
| `MOBILE_REVENUECAT_API_KEY_ANDROID` | `REVENUECAT_API_KEY_ANDROID` | RevenueCat Android key; empty → Subscribe falls back to the web upgrade page |

**Sign-off-gated + optional defines — the bridge carries them, the workflow does not pass them (yet):**

| Define | Value / effect |
|---|---|
| `OFF_ROUTE_ESCALATION_ENABLED` | off-route → notify-a-contact escalation; unset → the whole path stays inert. Owner + CISO + counsel sign-off. |
| `ADAPTIVE_FITNESS_GATE` | plan-generator-v2 P2 health-derived load → prescription; unset → exactly shipped P1. CISO / Security-Analyst sign-off. |
| `WEIGH_IN_GATE` | Art 9 checkpoint weigh-in fields; unset → never collected or sent. Owner + CISO + counsel sign-off. |
| `ENABLE_NEARBY_RUNNERS` | opt-in person-location discovery; unset → the surface is unreachable. Owner + CISO/counsel sign-off. |
| `USDA_FDC_API_KEY` | second food-search source; unset → Open Food Facts only, no error. |
| `TILE_URL_TEMPLATE` | `{z}/{x}/{y}` raster override that outranks MapTiler (decisions §68) — the wire for a self-hosted Protomaps migration. |

Every one of these is read through `main.dart`'s `String.fromEnvironment` bridge, so passing the define is all it takes to turn it on. That was not true before decisions §709: the three sign-off gates were absent from the bridge entirely, so a release build could not have flipped them however the deploy was configured. Adding a define to the workflow is now the *only* remaining step, and it stays a deploy-time decision the sign-off unlocks.

`DEV_USER_EMAIL` / `DEV_USER_PASSWORD` (auto-login) are bridged too but self-limiting — `shouldAutoLogin` only fires against a loopback `SUPABASE_URL`. `BYPASS_PAYWALL` is not read by the Flutter app at all.

### Manifest declarations to verify before launch

- `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` — required for GPS recording
- `android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` — required for background recording when the screen locks
- `android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION` — pedometer (steps)
- `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE` + `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION` — for the recording notification
- `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS` — for the run-in-progress notification on Android 13+
- `android.permission.INTERNET` + `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` — sync
- Health Connect: handled at runtime via the `health` package
- `BluetoothScan` / `BluetoothConnect` (Android 12+) — BLE chest-strap HR

The `BACKGROUND_LOCATION` permission is the most scrutinized at review time. The Play Store requires a **prominent in-app disclosure** explaining why we need it before requesting; that lives on the `OnboardingScreen`. Don't remove that disclosure.

### Health Connect permission changes gate the release

The app requests seven `android.permission.health.*` permissions, declared in both `AndroidManifest.xml` and `res/xml/health_permissions.xml` (keep the two in lockstep — the Play Console form reads the latter). Play holds a per-package **Health apps declaration** listing the data types we're approved for. It is version-independent, so a release that doesn't change the permission set needs nothing.

**A release that adds or removes one fails at the last step.** `mobile_android@1.4.0` added `READ_EXERCISE_ROUTES` (issue #664) and the Play upload died on:

```
Successfully uploaded 1 artifacts
Committing the Edit
##[error]You must let us know whether your app includes any health features.
```

The build, signing, and upload all succeeded — only `Edits.commit` was rejected, so the AAB was attached to the GitHub Release but never reached the internal track.

**The trap: the API and the Console disagree.** `r0adkll/upload-google-play` defaults `changesNotSentForReview: false`, so committing an edit *submits it for review*, and the declaration is enforced at review submission. Uploading the same AAB by hand to Internal testing in the Console does **not** hit that gate and publishes fine. This UI-vs-API divergence is reported against fastlane too ([#22204](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/22204), [#27960](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/27960)), both open and unresolved — it's Play-side, not specific to our action.

Two consequences worth internalising:

- **A manual Console upload masks the problem, it does not fix it.** The declaration stays stale, the next CI release fails identically, and promoting that build to Production *will* hit the review gate.
- **Do not "fix" this by setting `changesNotSentForReview: true`.** It would make CI green by skipping a real compliance check, and the debt lands on whoever next promotes to Production. Update the declaration instead.

The order that works:

1. Update `AndroidManifest.xml` + `res/xml/health_permissions.xml` together.
2. Update the Play Console Health apps declaration (**Policy and programs → App content → Health apps → Manage**, direct URL `https://play.google.com/console/app/app-content/summary`) to cover the new data-type set, with a per-type justification. Location-bearing types like exercise routes need the most detail.
3. Get CISO sign-off on the justification wording — it's a health-data compliance statement and becomes a public commitment.
4. Then tag the release.

Chicken-and-egg caveat: the declaration form appears to list only data types Play has seen in a processed bundle, so on a *new* permission the type may not be selectable until a bundle requesting it has been uploaded. Uploading the CI-built AAB by hand to Internal (it's attached to the GitHub Release) is enough to get Play to parse it — then the declaration can be completed.

Note the versionCode is derived from `git rev-list --count HEAD`, so a hand-uploaded build consumes it: re-running the failed CI job afterwards fails on a duplicate versionCode, and moving it needs a new commit on `main`, not just a new tag.

### targetSdk 36 (Android 16) — what to re-verify on-device

`targetSdk = 36` (Play requires it for updates from **2026-08-31**; `compileSdk` follows `flutter.compileSdkVersion`, currently 36). Android 16 behaviour changes that activate at this target and need a manual pass on an Android 16 device before release:

- **Edge-to-edge is mandatory** — `windowOptOutEdgeToEdgeEnforcement` is ignored on Android 16. Flutter's current stable handles insets, but verify the onboarding, recording (`run_screen`), and bottom-nav surfaces don't draw under the status/gesture bars.
- **Orientation / aspect-ratio restrictions ignored on ≥600 dp displays** — the app fills the window on tablets/foldables regardless of preferred orientation; check the recorder and map layouts at tablet widths.
- **Predictive back on by default** — verify back gestures from the recording screen still hit the in-app confirm flow rather than dismissing the activity.
- **Foreground-service recording** — no new FGS type is required (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION` stands), but soak-test a full background-locked recording on Android 16 for regressions in the tightened background-work quotas.
- **Notifications** — verify the live recording notification and push-notification taps; the app uses no full-screen intents, so `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT` is not needed.

---

## Privacy policy

Required for the Play listing. Host at `https://threkir.com/privacy` — a static SvelteKit route in `apps/web/src/routes/privacy/+page.svelte`. Must cover, at minimum:

- What we collect (location, optional HR, optional photos, account email)
- How we use it (display in app, sync to user's account, optional sharing)
- Who we share with (third parties: Strava if connected, Garmin if connected, RevenueCat for subscriptions, Anthropic for Coach prompts)
- Retention (lifetime of account; export available; deletion via `/settings/account`)
- User rights (GDPR-ish — data export, deletion, correction)
- Contact (`privacy@threkir.com`)

Also link the same URL from the Play Console under "Data safety → Privacy policy URL". Mismatch between the two = automatic review rejection.

---

## Data safety questionnaire

Play Console → App content → Data safety. Be precise; mismatches between the questionnaire and what the app actually does are a sticky cause of review delays.

| Data type | Collected? | Shared? | Optional? | Encrypted in transit? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Approximate location | Yes | No | No (required for the core function) | Yes |
| Precise location | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| Health & fitness — heart rate, steps | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Email address | Yes | No | No (account requirement) | Yes |
| Name | Yes (optional display name, setup wizard / profile) | No | Yes | Yes |
| User IDs | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| Device or other IDs | Yes (FCM push token → `device_tokens`, registered on sign-in when Firebase is configured) | No | No | Yes |
| Purchase history | Yes (Pro subscription state via RevenueCat / Play Billing) | No | Yes (only if the user subscribes) | Yes |
| Photos | Yes (if user uploads) | No | Yes | Yes |
| Other user-generated content | Yes (comments, club posts, route reviews, run notes, AI Coach chat messages) | No | Yes | Yes |
| App interactions / Diagnostics | Yes (Sentry crash reports) | No | Optional via opt-out | Yes |

"Shared" is **No** for everything we don't actively send to third-party servers. Strava / Garmin / RevenueCat / Anthropic are **only** invoked when the user signs in to those services or uses Coach, which counts as user-initiated rather than programmatic sharing. Phrasing in the questionnaire matters; if uncertain, default to the more conservative "Yes — Optional → user-initiated".

---

## Content rating — IARC interactive elements

The IARC questionnaire rates the *content* (a running app lands at "Everyone" / PEGI 3), but it also asks about **interactive elements**, which are displayed alongside the rating and must be declared truthfully:

- **Users Interact** — Yes: social feed, run comments, club posts, direct messages, coach chat.
- **Shares Location** — Yes: public run/route share pages and live spectator links expose (privacy-clipped) location.
- **Digital Purchases** — Yes: the Pro subscription in-app purchase.

A mismatch between these declarations and the binary is grounds for a rating recall or review rejection, same as the Data safety form.

---

## Release workflow — `mobile_android@*`

Triggered by tagging `mobile_android@1.2.3`. The workflow at `.github/workflows/release-android.yml`:

1. Checks out the tag.
2. Sets up Flutter SDK + JDK 17.
3. `melos bootstrap`.
4. Decodes `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` to a temp file.
5. Reads version from the tag (`1.2.3`); derives `versionCode` from `git rev-list --count HEAD`, and pins both into `pubspec.yaml`.
6. Decodes the keystore + writes `key.properties` (so the gradle release `signingConfig` engages), and stubs an empty `.env.development`.
7. `flutter build appbundle --release` with the production `--dart-define`s (§ Production config above) — the build is signed by gradle via `key.properties`, no separate sign step.
8. Uploads to Play Internal track via `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`.
9. Attaches the AAB to the GitHub Release that triggered the run.

Promotion from Internal to Beta to Production is **manual** through the Play Console after smoke-testing the Internal build.

---

## Observability

| Surface | Tool | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Crash reports | Sentry (mobile project) — bundled via `sentry_flutter` | $0 (free tier) → $26 (team) |
| Anomaly detection | Play Console → Statistics → Crashes & ANRs | included |
| User feedback | Play Console → User feedback | included |
| Vitals (excessive battery / wakeups / etc.) | Play Console → App quality → Android vitals | included |

**Sentry setup:** create a "mobile" project in Sentry. The DSN is a build-time `--dart-define`. `sentry_flutter` initialises in `lib/main.dart`'s `runZonedGuarded` boundary; releases are tagged with the `versionName` so a regression's release can be pinpointed.

**ANR alerts.** Sentry doesn't catch ANRs cleanly on Flutter. Watch the Play Console "Android vitals" panel weekly; an ANR rate >0.5% triggers warnings and eventually delisting from the Play Store's recommended lists.

---

## Cost projection

| Component | Tier | Monthly |
|---|---|---|
| Play Console developer fee | $25 one-time, not recurring | $0 |
| Sentry mobile | Free tier (50k events/mo across all projects) | $0 → $26 |
| **Subtotal** | | **$0–26** |

Marginal cost per install: $0.

---

## Rollback

The Play Store's release model is fundamentally roll-forward — every Play release ships a higher `versionCode` than the previous one. You can't re-deploy a lower `versionCode`.

**Halt rollout** is the closest thing to a rollback:

1. Play Console → Production → "Halt rollout" on the broken release.
2. Existing installs keep their version (whichever they auto-updated to).
3. New installs go back to receiving the previous release.
4. Tag a fix as `mobile_android@1.2.4` (higher than the broken `1.2.3`) and roll out.

If a release is so broken that "halt rollout" isn't fast enough, contact Play support for an "expedited review" of the next patch. Reserve this for genuine emergencies — abuse loses goodwill with reviewers.

---

## Disaster recovery

### Lost upload keystore

The single failure mode that's actually scary. The Play Store has a recovery flow:

1. File the "Reset upload key" support request from the Play Console.
2. Provide proof of identity + project ownership.
3. Google generates a new upload key; you swap it into GitHub Secrets.
4. Deploys resume.

This takes 2–7 days. **Keep the keystore in the estate secrets repo (sops, § Signing setup) and consider cold storage too** (a printed QR code in a fireproof safe, an encrypted backup at a friend's house, etc.). The cost of redundancy is zero; the cost of losing the only copy is a week of zero releases.

### Lost Play Console access

The Google account itself becoming inaccessible. Mitigations:

1. The developer account login is a dedicated role Gmail (§ Account identity), not a person.
2. Two admins on the Console — if one's account is locked the other can recover.
3. The role Gmail has 2FA backup codes printed, and its recovery address points at the Migadu inbox.

### Account banned

Rare, but if it happens (usually for ToS violations the team didn't realise applied) the path is appeals process → if denied, the app and all reviews are gone. **Mitigation:** read the Developer Program Policies before launch; especially the location-data, financial-services, and family-friendly sections. If the appeal succeeds the app comes back intact.
