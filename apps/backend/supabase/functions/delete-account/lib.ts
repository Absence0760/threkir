// ─── audit-log key derivation ───

/**
 * Pseudonymous hash of the user id, written to deletion_audit_log
 * so the table isn't itself a directory of deleted accounts.
 *
 * Two modes (keyed by whether `DELETION_AUDIT_KEY` is set):
 *
 *   * **Keyed (recommended)**: HMAC-SHA256(key, userId). An adversary
 *     who has a UUID and wants to test "was this user deleted?"
 *     cannot reproduce the hash without the key — the audit log
 *     becomes meaningfully pseudonymous. Set the env var to any
 *     ≥ 32-byte secret (operator task; see deployment.md).
 *
 *   * **Unkeyed (legacy)**: SHA-256(salt || userId). Same scheme as
 *     the original 20260917_001 audit log. Acceptable in the short
 *     term because the table is service-role only, but a holder of
 *     the UUID can reconstruct the hash and confirm deletion. The
 *     `audit/account-deletion-completeness` finding documents this.
 *
 * The mode is chosen per-call: existing rows under the legacy salt
 * are still resolvable by passing no key; new rows written after
 * the operator sets the env var use HMAC. Hex output either way.

 * Compact JSON encoding of the per-table row counts the delete-account
 * saga removed (or anonymised) before the auth-row cascade, written to
 * `deletion_audit_log.notes` on a successful erasure. It is the Art
 * 5(2) accountability counterpart to `third_party_outcomes`: a
 * structured "we deleted N jobs, M rate-limit rows, K reports, …" so a
 * regulator's "what did you actually erase for user X?" has an answer
 * beyond a bare `ok`.
 *
 * It rides in `notes` (rather than a dedicated column) because the
 * audit row's `result` already disambiguates: `result='ok'` → notes is
 * this counts JSON; a `*_failed` result → notes is the failure reason.
 * Only the tables the EF drains explicitly are counted — the rows that
 * vanish inside `auth.admin.deleteUser`'s FK cascade are not
 * individually visible to the handler.
 *
 * Returns null for an empty map (nothing was drained). Stays inside the
 * column's 200-char CHECK: the key set is small + bounded, but if a
 * freak total ever overruns we emit a still-valid-JSON summary rather
 * than risk a 23514 that would lose the whole audit row.
